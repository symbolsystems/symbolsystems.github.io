DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"The value of an expression of integer type shall not be implicitly
converted to a different underlying type if:
(...)
(c) the expression is not constant and is a function argument."
[MISRA-C:2004]

"The term 'underlying type' is defined as describing the type that would
be obtained from evaluating an expression if it were not for the effects
of integral promotion." [MISRA-C:2004]

"Integral promotion describes a process whereby arithmetic operations are
always conducted on integer operands of type int or long (signed or unsigned).
Operands of any other integer type, (char, short, bit-field and enum) are
always converted to type int or unsigned int before an arithmetic operation."
[MISRA-C:2004]

"The type char, the signed and unsigned integer types, and the enumerated
types are collectively called integral types." [ISO/IEC 9899:1990]

This rule detects when a function argument of integral type is implicitly
converted to another underlying type. This rule does not check constants
and complex expressions.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"By observing the principle whereby all operations are performed in
a consistent (underlying) type, it is possible to avoid programmer confusion
and some of the dangers associated with integral promotion." [MISRA-C:2004]

EXAMPLE

<PRE>

void takes_unsigned_int(unsigned int ui);
void takes_signed_int(signed int);
void takes_double(double d){}

void f1(unsigned int ui) {
    unsigned char uc;
    signed int* si_ptr;

    takes_unsigned_int(uc);                 /* Violation */
    takes_signed_int(ui);                   /* Violation */
    takes_double(*si_ptr);                  /* Violation */
