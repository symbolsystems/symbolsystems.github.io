Don't write code that depends on the order of evaluation of function calls [MISRA2004-12_2_g-3]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Apart from a few operators (notably the function call operator (), &amp;&amp;, ||, ?: 
and , (comma)) the order in which sub-expressions are evaluated is unspecified 
and can vary. This means that no reliance can be placed on the order of 
evaluation of sub-expressions, and in particular no reliance can be placed on 
the order in which side effects occur.
Functions may have additional effects when they are called (e.g. modifying some
global data). Dependence on order of evaluation could be avoided by invoking the
function prior to the expression that uses it, making use of a temporary 
variable for the value."

The rule reports a violation if in one expression are called two functions that
use the same global or static variable and at least one function modifies this 
variable.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
EXCEPTIONS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Only one level of function calls is checked.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Rule prevents evaluation of expression dependent on compiler version.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

int global;

int modify_global()
{
    global++;
    return global;
}
int use_global()
{
    return global;
}

void expr1()
{
    int a = modify_global() + use_global();  // Violation
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

int global;

int modify_global()
{
    global++;
    return global;
}
int use_global()
{
    return global;
}

void expr1()
{
    int a = modify_global();
    a += use_global();           // OK
}
