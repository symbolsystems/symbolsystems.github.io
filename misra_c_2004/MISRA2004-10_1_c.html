DESCRIPTION

<PRE>

"The value of an expression of integer type shall not be implicitly
converted to a different underlying type.
The term 'underlying type' is defined as describing the type that would
be obtained from evaluating an expression if it were not for the effects
of integral promotion."
"The intention when restricting implicit conversion of complex expressions
is to require that in a sequence of arithmetic operations within an expression, 
all operations should be conducted in exactly the same arithmetic type.
Notice that this does not imply that all operands in an expression are
of the same type.
The expression u32a + u16b + u16c is compliant - both additions will notionally
be performed in type U32.
The expression u16a + u16b + u32c is not compliant - the first addition
is notionally performed in type U16 and the second in type U32.
The word 'notionally' is used because, in practice, the type in which
arithmetic will be conducted will depend on the implemented size of an int."
Rule checks if implicit conversions of complex expressions are used.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"By observing the principle whereby all operations are performed in 
a consistent (underlying) type, it is possible to avoid programmer confusion 
and some of the dangers associated with integral promotion."

void Conv1_int( ) {
    unsigned short u16a,u16b;
    unsigned int u32a, u32b;

    u32a = u16b + u16a + u32b;          /* Violation */
    u32a = u32b + (u16a + u16b);        /* Violation */
}
