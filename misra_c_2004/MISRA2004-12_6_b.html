DESCRIPTION

<PRE>

"Expressions that are effectively Boolean should not be used as operands
 to operators other than (&amp;&amp;, ||, !, =, ==, !=, ?:).
An 'effectively Boolean' expression which is either 'Boolean-by-construct'
or 'Boolean-by-enforcement' as defined below.
Boolean-by-construct values are produced by the following operators:
- equality operators (== and !=)
- logical operators (!, &amp;&amp; and ||)
- relational operators (&lt;, &gt;, &lt;= and &gt;=)
Boolean-by-enforcement values can be introduced by implementing a specific type
enforcement mechanism using a tool. A Boolean type could be associated with
a specific typedef, and would then be used for any objects that are Boolean."

Rule reports violation if as an operand of operator 
other than (&amp;&amp;, ||, !, =, ==, !=, ?:) is used:
- Boolean-by-construct values
- boolean constant
- variable, parameter or expression of type:
  - bool,
  - typedef to bool,
  - enum that name begins with 'bool' (ignoring case)
    and that contains exactly 2 enum constant in body
  - typedef to char/short/int/enum which name begins with 'bool' (ignoring case) 
  - reference to above types

BENEFITS

<PRE>

Rule improves readability and maintainability.
Rule prevents confusion between logical and bitwise operators.

int goo();
void foo()
{
    int x, y, z;

    z = (x &gt; y) &amp; (goo()); // Violation
    z = x | (goo() != 0);  // Violation
    z = ~(x == y);         // Violation
}
