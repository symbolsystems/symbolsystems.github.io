DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"The type of an integer constant is a potential source of confusion,
because it is dependent on a complex combination of factors including:
- The magnitude of the constant
- The implemented sizes of the integer types
- The presence of any suffixes
- The number base in which the value is expressed (i.e. decimal, octal or
  hexadecimal)

Signedness of constants should be explicit. Consistent signedness is an
important principle in constructing well formed expressions. If a constant
is of an unsigned type, it is helpful to avoid ambiguity by applying a “U”
suffix. When applied to larger values, the suffix may be redundant (in the
sense that it does not influence the type of the constant); however its
presence is a valuable contribution towards clarity."

The rule checks if integer constant of unsigned type has 'U' or 'u' suffix.
