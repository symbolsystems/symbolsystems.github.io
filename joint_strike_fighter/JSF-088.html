DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Multiple inheritance shall only be allowed if at most one protected
implementation is used.

Rule counts number of base classes which:
* are directly inherited, and
* are inherited with protected access specifier, and
* are not "interfaces"

A violation is reported when more than one such class is found.

An "interface" is a class which has no member variables and all
member functions (except for destructor) are pure virtual.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Simpler and easier to maintain and understand inheritance hierarchy.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

// Non-interface (implementation)
class A { int x; };

// Non-interface (implementation)
struct B { virtual void foo(); };

// Examples of non-compliant code:

// More than one protected implementation inheritance:
struct D : protected A, protected B { };   // Violation



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

// Non-interface (implementation)
class A { int x; };

// Non-interface (implementation)
struct B { virtual void foo(); };

// Interface
struct C { virtual void foo() = 0; };

// Examples of compliant code:

// One protected implementation inheritance:
struct D : protected A, private B { };   // OK

// One protected implementation inheritance, one protected interface:
class E : protected A, protected C { };   // OK
