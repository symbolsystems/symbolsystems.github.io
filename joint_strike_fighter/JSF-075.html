DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Members of a class are initialized in the order in which they are declared, 
not the order in which they appear in the initialization list."

"Recall that the destructors for the members of an object are always called 
in the inverse order of their constructors. Thus, if members were initialized 
in the order of their appearance in an initialization list, compilers would 
have to keep track of the order in which the members were initialized for each 
object, just to ensure that the destructors would be called in the right order. 
That would be an expensive proposition. To avoid that overhead, the order 
of construction and destruction is the same for all objects of a given type, 
and the order of members in an initialization list is ignored."

"Base class data members are initialized before derived class data members,
so if you're using inheritance, you should list base class initializers
at the very beginning of your member initialization lists. If you're using
multiple inheritance, your base classes will be initialized in the order
in which you inherit from them; the order in which they're listed in your
member initialization lists will again be ignored."

BENEFITS

<PRE>

The rule prevents reading from uninitialized variables and improves
readability and maintainability of code.

class A {
public:
    A( int x ) : a( x ), b( a ) {}         // Violation
private:
    int b;
    int a;
};

class B : public A {
public:
    B( int );
private:
    int a;
    int b;
};

B::B( int y ) : a( 5 ), A( a ), b( y ) {}  // Violation

class A {
public:
    A( int x ) : b( x ), a( b ) {}           // OK - 'b' is declared before 'a'

    int a;
};

class B : public A {
public:
    B( int );
private:
    int a;
    int b;

B::B( int y ) : A( 5 ), a( 5 ),  b( y ) {}   // OK - Base class data members
                                             //      are initialized before
                                             //      derived class data members

   A8-5-1. In an initialization list, the order of initialization shall be
   following: (1) virtual base classes in depth and left to right order of the
   inheritance graph, (2) direct base classes in left to right order of
   inheritance list, (3) non-static data members in the order they were
   declared in the class definition
