DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Every file that contains source code must be documented with an introductory
comment that provides information on the file name and its contents."

The rule requires that before the first use of source code in file
should be a comment containing the 'file' word (case insensitive).
It is allowed to place characters different that letters and numbers
directly before or after the 'file' word (e.g. '*file:' is correct,
'file2' is not correct).
The rule checks /* */ and // comments.
