DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"An array which is a member of a non-lvalue expression with structure
or union type shall not be used as a value, other than as the immediate
postfix-expression operand to a subscript operator. The subscript operator
shall not be used to produce a modifiable lvalue." [MISRA C:2012 Amendment 3]

"A non-lvalue expression with structure or union type, where the structure
or union contains a member with array type (including, recursively, members
of all contained structures and unions) refers to an object with automatic
storage duration and temporary lifetime. Its lifetime begins when
the expression is evaluated and its initial value is the value
of the expression. Its lifetime ends when the evaluation of the containing
full expression or full declarator ends. Any attempt to modify an object with
temporary lifetime results in undefined behavior." [ISO/IEC 9899:2011]

This rule detects access to an array member of a structure or union object
with a temporary lifetime that was created as a result of a function call,
or by using a conditional, assignment, or comma operator, except when it is
used as the immediate postfix-expression operand to a subscript operator
that does not produce a modifiable lvalue.
