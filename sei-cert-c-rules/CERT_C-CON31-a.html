Do not destroy another thread's mutex [CERT_C-CON31-a-3]
</STRONG>
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>
DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>
This rule detects when a lock is destroyed without ensuring that all the threads that may be using
this lock have finished. 
The rule must be parameterized with a list of user-defined functions that are called to ensure
that the threads have finished. If the list is not provided, the rule will report a violation
each time a lock-destroying function is used in code. 



</PRE>
<STRONG>
SINCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>
v10.3.2



</PRE>
<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Some functions may be defined as simple wrappers for lock-destroying functions and may not ensure that
all the threads that use a lock have finished. Violations will be reported in such wrappers, unless their own
multithreading API is defined in test configurations where the wrappers are defined as lock-destroying functions.

SECURITY RELEVANCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>
"Destroying a mutex while it is locked may result in invalid control flow and data corruption".
SEI CERT C Coding Standard,
CON31-C. Do not destroy a mutex while it is locked



</PRE>
<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>
The "Functions that ensure that all the threads have finished" parameter allows you to specify a list
of functions that can be used to check if all the threads that use a lock have finished. When one of these
functions is called before destroying a lock, a violation will not be reported.

The following columns allow you to define different aspects of functions in the tables: 

* The 'Enabled' column can be used to temporarily disable some of the defined functions
  for Flow Analysis.

* The 'Fully qualified type name or namespace (wildcard)' column should be used to provide
  the fully qualified name of the type or namespace where the function is declared.
  Use '*' if you want to describe a function declared in any type or namespace, or
  a global function declared outside of any type or namespace.

* The 'Function name (wildcard)' column should contain the name of the described function.

* The '+ definitions in subclasses' column is used to indicate whether the current row will apply
  to functions with the given name defined in subclasses of the given class. Note that this
  applies to both instance and non-instance functions.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>
This rule helps you prevent data corruption and violation of data integrity, as well as maintain
proper control flow.

<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Here is an example that will trigger a violation:

#include &lt;pthread.h&gt;

pthread_mutex_t theLock;
int data;
 
int cleanupAndFinish(void) {
    int result;
   
    if ((result = pthread_mutex_destroy(&amp;theLock)) != 0) { // VIOLATION
        /* Handle error */
    }
    data++;
    return data;
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>
The example can be repaired by adding a function that ensures that all the threads are finished
before the lock is destroyed.

#include &lt;pthread.h&gt;

void wait_for_all_threads_to_finish();

pthread_mutex_t theLock;
int data;
 
int cleanupAndFinish(void) {
    int result;
   
    wait_for_all_threads_to_finish();
    if ((result = pthread_mutex_destroy(&amp;theLock)) != 0) { // NO VIOLATION
        /* Handle error */
    }
    data++;
    return data;
}
