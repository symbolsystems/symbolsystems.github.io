DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Execution of threads are paused using appropriate functions. A waiting thread
resumes execution only after it has been notified that the condition predicate
is true. A condition predicate is an expression constructed from the variables
of a function that must be true for a thread to be allowed to continue
execution.

When functions that pause and resume threads are called inside an 'if' block
that checks the condition predicate, the condition predicate is checked only
after the notification is received. As a result, if the notification is
spurious or malicious, the thread would wake up prematurely. For this reason,
it is recommended to use a loop to ensure that the condition predicate is
checked both before and after the call.

This rule detects when one of the following functions is called outside of any
loop (while, do-while, for): cnd_wait(), cnd_timedwait(), cond_wait(),
cond_timedwait(), cond_reltimedwait(), pthread_cond_wait(),
pthread_cond_timedwait(), pthread_cond_reltimedwait_np(),
std::condition_variable::wait(), std::condition_variable::wait_for(),
std::condition_variable::wait_until().

The rule does not verify if a loop contains a correct condition.

"The std::condition_variable::wait() function has an overloaded form
that accepts a function object representing the predicate. This form of wait()
behaves as if it were implemented as while (!pred()) wait(lock);."
[CERT-CON54-CPP]

This solution is also valid for the wait_for() and wait_until() functions.

#include &lt;condition_variable&gt;
#include &lt;mutex&gt;

extern bool until_finish(void);
extern std::mutex m;
extern std::condition_variable condition;

void func()
{
    std::unique_lock&lt;std::mutex&gt; lk(m);
    condition.wait(lk, []{ return until_finish(); });      // OK
}

BENEFITS

<PRE>

The rule prevents indefinite blocking and denial of service attack (an attempt
to make a computer resource unavailable to its intended users).
