Do not compare two unrelated pointers [CERT_C-ARR36-b-2]
</STRONG>
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>
DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>
This rule detects when two unrelated pointers are compared.

By default, the rule assumes that two pointers are related if they store
addresses of two elements of the same array. Additionally, the rule can be
parameterized to assume that two pointers that point to two elements of
the same structure object are related (see PARAMETERS).
 

</PRE>
<STRONG>
SINCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>
v10.4.1


</PRE>
<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>
The rule assumes that the following operators can be used for pointer
comparison:
	operator&gt;
	operator&lt;
	operator&gt;=
	operator&lt;=
	std::less()
	std::greater()
	std::less_equal()
	std::greater_equal()

You can parameterize the rule to customize the list of operators the rule
will check (see PARAMETERS).


</PRE>
<STRONG>
SECURITY RELEVANCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Comparison of unrelated pointers may cause undefined behavior.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>
If the "Report when the pointers are compared using relational operators"
parameter is enabled, the rule detects when pointers are compared with
the following operators:
	operator&gt;
	operator&lt;
	operator&gt;=
	operator&lt;=
This option is enabled by default.
	
If the "Report when the pointers are compared using standard functions" parameter 
is enabled, the rule detects when pointers are compared with the following
operators:
	std::less()
	std::greater()
	std::less_equal()
	std::greater_equal()
This option is enabled by default.
	
If the "Treat pointers addressing fields of the same object as related"
parameter is enabled, the rule assumes that that two pointers that address
elements of the same structure object (for example, two fields of the same
object) are related. This option is disabled by default.

If "Aggressive mode" is enabled, the rule additionally reports pointer
comparison in cases when Flow Analysis is unable to positively verify that
the compared pointers are related and there is probability that reported
violations are false positives. Enabling this parameter results in better
bug detection, but it may increase the number of false alarms. 
With this parameter disabled, the rule only triggers when Flow Analysis can
conclusively determine that the compared pointers are not related. This option
is disabled by default.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>
This rule helps you avoid undefined behavior that may be caused by
comparing unrelated pointers.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Here is an example that triggers a violation:

#include &lt;cstddef&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
  
template &lt;typename Ty&gt;
bool in_range(const Ty *test, const Ty *r, size_t n) {
    return (test &gt;= r) &amp;&amp; (test &lt; (r + (std::ptrdiff_t)n));  // VIOLATION x2
}
  
void f() {
    double foo[10];
    double *x = &amp;foo[0];
    double bar;
    std::cout &lt;&lt; std::boolalpha &lt;&lt; in_range(&amp;bar, x, 10);
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
  
template &lt;typename Ty&gt;
bool in_range(const Ty *test, const Ty *r, size_t n) {
    auto *cur = reinterpret_cast&lt;const unsigned char *&gt;(r);
    auto *end = reinterpret_cast&lt;const unsigned char *&gt;(r + n);
    auto *testPtr = reinterpret_cast&lt;const unsigned char *&gt;(test);
  
    for (; cur != end; ++cur) {
        if (cur == testPtr) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
  
void f() {
    double foo[10];
    double *x = &amp;foo[0];
    double bar;
    std::cout &lt;&lt; std::boolalpha &lt;&lt; in_range(&amp;bar, x, 10);
}
