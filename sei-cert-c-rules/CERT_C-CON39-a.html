DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>
"The C Standard, 7.26.5.6 [ISO/IEC 9899:2011], states that a thread shall not be joined 
once it was previously joined or detached. Similarly, subclause 7.26.5.3 states that a thread 
shall not be detached once it was previously joined or detached".
[SEI CERT C Coding Standard, CON39-C. Do not join or detach a thread that was previously joined or detached]

This rule detects code flow paths where a thread object that is joined or detached was previously
joined or detached.

Do not detach the previously joined thread: 

#include &lt;pthread.h&gt;
   
void* thread_func(void *arg) {
	/* Do work */  
  	return 0;
}

void test() {
	 
	pthread_t thread_id;

	pthread_create (&amp;thread_id, NULL, &amp;thread_func, NULL);
    pthread_join(thread_id, 0);     // NO VIOLATION
