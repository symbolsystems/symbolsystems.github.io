Cast characters to unsigned char before converting to larger integer sizes [CERT_C-STR34-d-2]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

For implementations in which the char type is defined to have the same
range, representation and behavior as signed char, the character value
is sign-extended when assigned to the singed integer variable. For character
code 255 decimal, this sign extension results in the value -1 being assigned
to the integer that is indistinguishable from EOF.

It is a compliant solution to cast signed character data to unsigned char
before it is assigned or converted to a larger signed integer type.

This rule detects when an expression of the plain char type
that is defined to have the same range, representation and behavior
as signed char is used as the operand of the following operators:
- unary '+', '-'
- binary '+', '-', '*', '/', '%', '&lt;&lt;', '&gt;&gt;'
- compound '+=', '-=', '*=', '/=', '%=', '&lt;&lt;=', '&gt;&gt;=' (only right hand
  operand)
and implicitly promoted to a larger signed type.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"This rule is applicable only in cases where the character data may contain
values that can be interpreted as negative numbers. For example, if the char
type is represented by a two's complement 8-bit value, any character value
greater than +127 is interpreted as a negative value." [CERT-STR34-C]

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule prevents conversions that may cause wrong computation result.

int foo(char ch)

    int i = -ch;                            /* Violation */

    if (ch + '0' &gt;= 9)                      /* Violation */
    {
        i = ch &lt;&lt; 1;                        /* Violation */
