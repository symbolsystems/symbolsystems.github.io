Identifiers shall not simultaneously have both internal and external linkage in the same translation unit [CERT_C-DCL36-a-2]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"For an identifier declared with the storage-class specifier 'extern'
in a scope in which a prior declaration of that identifier is visible,
if the prior declaration specifies internal or external linkage, the
linkage of the identifier at the later declaration is the same as the
linkage specified at the prior declaration. If no prior declaration
is visible, or if the prior declaration specifies no linkage, then
the identifier has external linkage." [ISO/IEC 9899:1999]

"If, within a translation unit, the same identifier appears with both
internal and external linkage, the behavior is undefined." [ISO/IEC 9899:1999]

This rule detects when:
- a function or an object is declared with the explicit 'extern' specifier,
  while it has another declaration with internal linkage in the same
  translation unit
- a function or an object is declared with the explicit 'extern' specifier
  in the unnamed namespace
- an object is declared with the explicit 'static' specifier, while it
  has another declaration with external linkage in the same translation unit

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Having names with both internal and external linkage can be confusing
since the objects to which they actually refer may not be obvious." [JSF]

This rule helps you improve readability of code and prevent confusion
or undefined behavior.

EXAMPLE

<PRE>

static int x1;
static int x2;
static void f1();
static void f2(){}

extern int x1;         // Violation
extern void f1(){}     // Violation

void foo( ) {
    extern int x2;     // Violation
    extern void f2();  // Violation
}
