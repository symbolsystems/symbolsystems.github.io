The "Reporting violations where variable is known to be null due to a null check" group of parameters:

Enable or disable this check box to specify which violations are reported:
   * If disabled, the rule will report violations only on variables that are certain to be assigned with a null value.
   * If enabled, there rule will report violations not only for null value assignment, 
     but also when a check for a null value that stipulates null pointer dereferencing at the point of use is detected.

Here is an example of the second type of violations:

    int b = (ptr == 0); /* null check that stipulates null dereferencing at violation point */
    /* ... */
    if (b) {
        /* ... */
        int i = *ptr; /* violation reported if the check box is ticked */
    }

The "Exclude cases when a null check is performed inside:" set of parameters helps you reduce the number of
unwanted violations caused by a null check. For cases when a function or a macro performs a null check,
these parameters determine whether it should be assumed that the corresponding variable can be null
in the callers of the function.

The "a macro invocation" parameter determines how the rule handles null checks in macros.
Consider the following example:
 
    #define FOO(P) if (P == 0) { /* ... */ }
    
    void bar(int* p)
    {
        FOO(p);
        *p = 10; /* Violation or not? */
    }
    
If this option is disabled, a violation will be reported for the above example.   

Other parameters in this set are related to the visibility of functions.
Consider the following example:

    int* foo(int* p)
    {
        if (p == 0) {
            /* ... */
        }
        return p; 
    }
    
    void bar(int* p)
    {
        foo(p);
        *p = 10; /* Violation or not? */
    }

Whether the violation inside bar() will be reported or not depends on the visibility of foo()'s 
and parameterization of the rule.

"a called function with internal linkage"
If this option is disabled, a violation will be reported in the above example if the foo() function is 
a function with internal linkage (a function that is visible only in the compilation unit where it is defined).
Static global functions and functions from anonymous namespaces are functions with internal linkage. 

"a called global function"
If this option is disabled, a violation will be reported in the above example if the foo() function is
a global non-member function. 

"a called member function of the following visibility:"
This parameter defines the behavior of the rule for cases where foo() is a member function.
If this option is disabled, a violation will always be reported in the above example if foo() is a member function.
If this option is enabled, the following radio group of parameters is available:

   * "public" 
   * "public, protected"
   * "any visibility"

The table below shows all the possible options of the radio group of parameters. Each row represents one of
the parameters. The "+" character indicates that a violation will be reported in the above example.

                                  member function visibility (foo)
Parameterization:                 | public | protected | private |
"public"                          |    -   |     +     |   +     |
"public, protected"               |    -   |     -     |   +     |
"any visibility"                  |    -   |     -     |   -     |



The "Functions that do not accept NULL as their parameters" table allows you to list functions
whose parameters are not allowed to accept null.

The "External functions that may return NULL" table allows you to handle external functions
that can potentially return null.
To achieve better results, the rule provides a predefined set of such null returners from
standard libraries. Those predefined functions are used by default. They cannot be edited
or removed from the list, but they can be enabled/disabled in the "Enabled" column. Select or clear
the check box next to the function name to enable or disable the function.
Additionally, you can extend the set of null returners to include additional functions that
you assume may return null. 

The following columns allow you to define different aspects of functions in the tables: 

* The 'Enabled' column can be used to temporarily disable some of the defined functions
  for Flow Analysis.

* The 'Fully qualified type name or namespace (wildcard)' column should be used to provide
  the fully qualified name of the type or namespace where the function is declared.
  Use '*' if you want to describe a function declared in any type or namespace, or
  a global function declared outside of any type or namespace.

* The 'Function name (wildcard)' column should contain the name of the described function.

* The '+ definitions in subclasses' column is used to indicate whether the current row will apply
  to functions with the given name defined in subclasses of the given class. Note that this
  applies to both instance and non-instance functions.

* The 'Non-NULL parameters' column allows you to specify 
  the list of ordinal numbers of the function parameters that are not allowed to accept null.
  List the indexes of parameters separated by a comma or use '*' to specify that all parameters are affected.

A step-by-step example of how to create your own null returner is provided in the 'EXAMPLE' 
section of this help page.

The "Treat "dynamic_cast" conversion as a source of the null value" parameter allows you
to specify if "dynamic_cast" conversion will be considered to be a source of null. 
This option is enabled by default.

class A {virtual void f();};  
class B : public A {void bar();}; 

static void foo(A* p)
{
    B* d = dynamic_cast&lt;B*&gt;(p); // the source of null if the option is enabled
    d-&gt;bar(); // a violation is reported if the option is enabled
}

<PRE>
Example#1 - Some code excerpts for which the rule reports a violation:

static void nullPointerDereference()
{
    int* pointerToNull = 0;
    int variable = *pointerToNull; /* VIOLATION */
}

static void zeroTracking()
{
    int* pointerValue = 0;
    int* pointerToNull = pointerValue;
    int variable = *pointerToNull; /* VIOLATION */
}

static void multiPointer()
{
    int* zero = 0;
    int** ppi = &amp;zero;
    int* pi = *ppi;
    int k = *pi; /* VIOLATION */
}


Example#2 - custom null returner creation:
Consider the following code assuming createInstance() to be a potential null returner:

namespace mySpace {
    class MyClass
    {
        public:
            int getNumber();
            static MyClass* createInstance();
    };
}

static void usingFactory()
{
    mySpace::MyClass* instance = mySpace::MyClass::createInstance();
    int num = instance-&gt;getNumber(); // VIOLATION
}

In order to detect possible null pointer dereferencing in the code above, 
the rule should be parameterized as follows:

 - Add a custom null returner:
       'Fully qualified type name or namespace' field value: "mySpace::MyClass";
       'Function name' field value: "createInstance";
       Use '+ definitions in subclasses' if createInstance() defined in subclasses
       of mySpace::MyClass may return null as well.
