DESCRIPTION

<PRE>

"A loop-control-variable other than the loop-counter which is modified
in statement shall have type bool.
A loop-control-variable is any variable occurring in for-init-statement,
condition or expression.
A loop-counter is a loop-control-variable that is:
  - Initialized in, or prior to, for-init-statement; and
  - an operand to a relational operator in condition; and
  - modified in expression.
loop-control-variables are typically used to terminate a for loop early.
The code is easier to understand if this is done with the use
of Boolean values"

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule assumes that an object is modified if it is passed to the function
as a reference to a non-const object (except a universal reference) or its
address is passed to the function as a pointer to a non-const object 
(except functions which are called via function pointers).



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Rule improves readability of code.
