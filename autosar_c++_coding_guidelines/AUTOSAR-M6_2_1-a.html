Assignment operators shall not be used in expressions that yield a Boolean value [AUTOSAR-M6_2_1-a-2]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"No assignments are permitted in any expression which is considered to have a 
Boolean value. This precludes the use of both simple and compound assignment 
operators in the operands of a Boolean-valued expression. However, it does not 
preclude assigning a Boolean value to a variable. If assignments are required 
in the operands of a Boolean-valued expression then they must be performed 
separately outside of those operands. This helps to avoid getting "=" and "==" 
confused, and assists the static detection of mistakes."

<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

An expression is considered to represent a Boolean value either because
it appears in a position where a Boolean value is expected or because it
uses an operator that gives rise to a Boolean value. Boolean values are
expected in the following contexts:
- the controlling expression of an if statement
- the controlling expression of an iteration statement
- the first operand of the conditional operator ?

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Rule prevents getting "=" and "==" confused.

EXAMPLE

<PRE>

void foo() 
{
    int x;
    int y;
    int z;
    z = !(x = y);                // Violation
    if ((x &gt; y) &amp;&amp; (x = 4));  // Violation
    if (!(x = y));                // Violation
}

    z = !(x == y);               // OK
    if ((x &gt; y) &amp;&amp; (x == 4)); // OK
    if (!(x == y));               // OK
