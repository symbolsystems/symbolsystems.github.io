DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"There are three major kinds of invalid objects:
- Destroyed objects: Typical examples are automatic objects that have gone out
  of scope and deleted heap-based objects.
- Semantically invalidated objects: Typical examples include dangling pointers
  to deleted objects (e.g., a pointer p after a delete p;) and invalidated 
  iterators. It is generally undefined and unsafe to do anything except assign
  another valid value to an invalidated object.
- Objects that were never valid.
Be aware of object lifetimes and validity. Never dereference an invalid iterator
or pointer. Don't make assumptions about what delete does and doesn't do; 
freed memory is freed, and shouldn't be subsequently accessed under
any circumstances."

The rule reports violations on the use of pointers to deleted objects.

<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule checks only simple cases (use of variables, parameters, 
a[b], a.b, a-&gt;b, or *a expressions after they were deleted).
The rule does not check a flow. It assumes that pointer to deleted object
is used if between 'delete' and an use of that pointer there is no 'case',
'default', 'break', 'continue', 'return', 'throw', 'goto', exit(), abort().



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Rule prevents writing unsafe and error prone code.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

char* foo1( ) {	
    char * a = new char;
    delete a;
    return a;         // Violation
};

char* foo2(char * ptr){
    char * a = new char;
    if(a &gt; ptr){
        delete a;
        (*a)++;       // Violation
    } else {
        (*a)++;       // OK
    }
    a = ptr + 1;
    return a;         // OK
}
