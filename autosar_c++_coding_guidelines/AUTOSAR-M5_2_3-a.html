DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"A downcast occurs when a class type is converted to another class type that
is derived from that first class. Polymorphism enables strong abstraction
between the interface and implementation of a hierarchy. Explicit casts
bypass this layer of abstraction resulting in higher levels of coupling
and dependency."

"Casting from a base class to a derived class is unsafe unless some mechanism
is provided to ensure that the cast is legitimate."

class D : public B
