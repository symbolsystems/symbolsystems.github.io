DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>
An integer overflow occurs when an integer value is incremented to a value that
is too large to store in the associated representation. When this occurs for
signed integers, it causes undefined behavior.

Similarly, an integer underflow occurs when an integer value is decremented to
a value that is too small to store in the associated representation. When this
occurs for signed integers, it causes undefined behavior.

This rule reports a violation when an overflow or underflow occurs in the signed
integer arithmetic operation.

SECURITY RELEVANCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Signed integer overflow leads to undefined behavior.

Integer overflow can sometimes trigger buffer overflows that can
be used to execute arbitrary code, as well as lead to memory corruption. This
is usually outside the scope of a program's implicit security policy.

Unexpected integer overflow can be very dangerous if the result value is used in
a sensitive area, such as:
- Integer operands of any pointer arithmetic, including array indexing
- The assignment expression for the declaration of a variable length array
- The postfix expression preceding square brackets [] or the expression in
square brackets [] of a subscripted designation of an element of an array object
- Function arguments of type size_t or rsize_t (for example, an argument to a
memory allocation function)
- Loop conditions
- In security-critical code

<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>
'Violate on overflow' - when enabled, violations will be reported when an
overflow occurs, i.e. the result of the arithmetic operation is higher than the
upper boundary value for the given type.
This option is enabled by default.

'Violate on underflow' - when enabled, violations will be reported when an
underflow occurs, i.e. the result of the arithmetic operation is lower than the
lower boundary value for the given type.
This option is enabled by default.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>
This rule helps you prevent undefined behavior.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

void example() {
    signed char c = 127;
    c += 1; // VIOLATION
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Use a wider type or validate ranges before the arithmetic operation:

void repair() {
    signed char c = 127;
    if (c &lt; 127) {
        c += 1; // NO VIOLATION
    }
}
