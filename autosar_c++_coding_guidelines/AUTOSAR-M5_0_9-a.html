DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Rule reports violation if the value of a complex expression of integer type
is cast to a type that has different signedness or is wider than
the underlying type of the expression.
"The term 'complex expression' is defined to mean any expression that is not:
  - a constant expression
  - an lvalue (i.e. an object)
  - the return value of a function
The term 'underlying type' is defined as describing the type that would
be obtained from evaluating an expression if it were not for the effects
of integral promotion."

BENEFITS

<PRE>

The rule prevents behaviours inconsistent with developer expectations.

void myFunction()

    unsigned int ui1, ui2;
    signed int si1, si2;
    unsigned short us1, us2;
    double d;
	
    ui1 = (unsigned int)(si1 + si2); /* Violation - cast from signed to unsigned type */
    si1 = (signed int)(ui1 / ui2);   /* Violation - cast from unsigned to signed type */
    ui1 = (unsigned int)(us1 - us2); /* Violation - cast from narrower to wider type */
    d = (double)(ui1 * ui2);         /* Violation - cast from integer to floating type */
