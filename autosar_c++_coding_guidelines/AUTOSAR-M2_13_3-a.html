DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"The type of an integer is dependent on a complex combination of factors
including:
- The magnitude of the constant;
- The implemented sizes of the integer types;
- The presence of any suffixes;
- The number base in which the value is expressed.
For example, the value 0x8000 is of type unsigned int in a 16-bit environment,
but of type (signed) int in a 32-bit environment. If an overload set includes
candidates for an unsigned int and an int, then the overload that would be
matched by 0x8000 is therefore dependent on the implemented integer size.
Adding a "U" suffix to the value specifies that it is unsigned."
