DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Using the pre-processor #error directive may lead to code that is complicated
and not clear for developers. The #error directive can not be applied
to templates as it will not be evaluated as a per-instance template deduction."
[AUTOSAR A16-6-1]

This rule detects '#error' pre-processor directives.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Static assertion, similarly to #error directive, provides a compile-time error
checking. However, static_assert behaves correctly in all C++ concepts and makes
the code more readable and does not rely on pre-processor directives."
[AUTOSAR-16-6-1]
