DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"When a value of integer type is converted to a real floating type,
if the value being converted can be represented exactly in the new type,
it is unchanged. If the value being converted is in the range of values
that can be represented but cannot be represented exactly, the result
is either the nearest higher or nearest lower representable value,
chosen in an implementation-defined manner. If the value being converted
is outside the range of values that can be represented, the behavior
is undefined."

This rule assumes the representation of floating point numbers follows
specifation of IEEE 754 (IEC 60559), where single precision numbers ("float")
has significand with a precision of 24 bits, and double precision numbers
("double") has significand with a precision of 53 bits. This means that any
integer with absolute value less than 2^24 can be exactly represented in the
single precision format, and any integer with absolute value less than 2^53 can
be exactly represented in the double precision format. 

This means that float and double types should be able to exactly represent
integer values in following ranges:
- float: from -16777215 to 16777215
- double: from -9007199254740991 to 9007199254740991

The rule reports a violation if an integer constant is implicitly converted to
a floating type and its value is not in the specified range (the loss of data
is possible).

Implicit conversion can happen when assigning, comparing or mixing integer and
floating types.

Rule does not check and will not report on constant expression, even if it's
value is out of specified range. For example:
    float f = (8388608 * 3);        /* OK - not a simple constant */

    f = -16777216;             /* Violation */
    f + 16777216;              /* Violation */
    db(9007199254740992);      /* Violation */
