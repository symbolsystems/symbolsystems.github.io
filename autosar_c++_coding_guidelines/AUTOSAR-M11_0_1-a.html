DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"By implementing class interfaces with member functions, the implementation
retains more control over how the object state can be modified, and helps
to allow a class to be maintained without affecting clients." [MISRA C++:2008]

This rule detects public and protected data members that are declared
in non-POD classes, structures or unions.

NOTES

<PRE>

POD is an abbreviation for Plain Old Data.

A class, struct, or union is a non-POD type if it meets at least one of the 
following conditions:
- it is not an aggregate,
- it has a non-static member with a non-POD type (or an array of non-POD
  elements),
- it has a non-static member with type reference,
- it has a user-declared copy assignment operator,
- it has a user-declared destructor.

A class, struct, or union is an aggregate if it meets all the following conditions:
- it has no user-declared constructors,
- it has no private or protected non-static data members,
- it has no base classes,
- it has no virtual functions.

BENEFITS

This rule helps you prevent unauthorized access and modifications of data
members.

class C

protected:
    int m2;        // Violation

    S();
    int m1;        // Violation
