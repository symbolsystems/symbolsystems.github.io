Do not delete objects with incomplete class at the point of deletion [AUTOSAR-A5_3_3-a-2]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

If the object being deleted has incomplete class type at the point of deletion
and the complete class has a non-trivial destructor or a deallocation function,
the behavior is undefined.

For example in some implementations neither the destructor nor the
class-specific operator delete will be called, even if they are declared when
the class is defined.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
SINCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

v9.4.1



</PRE>
<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Rule reports violation even if class has no non-trivial destructor or a
deallocation function.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
EXCEPTIONS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

For templates rule checks only if type is complete at the end of translation
unit - a violation is reported if only forward declaration is provided.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Rule prevents undefined behavior.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

class X;
struct Y;
void foo(X *x, Y* y) {
    delete x; // Violation - incomplete class at point of deletion
    delete y; // Violation - incomplete class at point of deletion
}
struct Y {};



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

// Make sure that deleted objects have complete class before the deletion
class X {};
struct Y {};
void foo(X *x, Y* y) {
    delete x; // OK
    delete y; // OK
}
