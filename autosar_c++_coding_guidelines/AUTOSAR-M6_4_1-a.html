'if' and 'else' should be followed by a compound statement [AUTOSAR-M6_4_1-a-2]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"An 'if' (expression) construct shall be followed by a compound statement. 
The 'else' keyword shall be followed by either a compound statement, 
or another 'if' statement.

It is possible for a developer to mistakenly believe that a sequence
of statements forms the body of a selection-statement by virtue of their
indentation. The accidental inclusion of a semi-colon after the controlling
expression is a particular danger, leading to a null control statement.
Using a compound-statement clearly defines which statements actually form
the body. Additionally, it is possible that indentation may lead a developer
to associate an 'else' statement with the wrong 'if'."
