DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"There are three distinct char types, plain char, signed char and unsigned char.
Signed char and unsigned char shall be used for numeric data and plain char
shall be used for character data. The signedness of the plain char type
is implementation-defined and should not be relied upon."

The rule reports a violation if signed char or unsigned char is used
for character data.

BENEFITS

Rule makes the code more readable and less confusing.
