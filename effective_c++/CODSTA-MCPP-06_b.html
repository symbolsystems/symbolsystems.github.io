DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

One of the ways to make a class uncopyable is to make it a derived class
of another base class that has a privately defined copy constructor and copy
assignment, with no implementation. This moves subtle run-time bugs into
compile- or link- time. In C++11, we can now explicitly declare a class with
deleted functions with the 'delete' specifier, instead of using a base class
with private methods.

This rule detects when a class inherits from a base class that includes
only private undefined copy constructor and copy assignment operators.
