Do not call lock() directly on a mutex [CODSTA-MCPP-21-4]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule detects when the 'lock()' member function is called directly on the
object of 'std::mutex' type.

Calling the 'lock()' and 'unlock()' functions directly on a mutex is not
preferable. If you fail to release a lock that is held, or if an exception
is thrown before the 'unlock()' function is called, all other threads that are
waiting on the resource will be indefinitely blocked and the program may hang.

For this reason, it is recommended to use 'std::lock_guard' or
'std::unique_lock', which use RAII to manage the duration of the mutex lock.

The std::lock_guard class keeps its associated mutex locked during the entire
life time by acquiring the lock on construction and releasing the lock on
destruction.

BENEFITS

<PRE>

This rule helps you ensure that critical sections are unlocked and provide
stronger exception safety, because any critical section is automatically
unlocked when the stack is unwound after an exception is thrown.

EXAMPLE

#include &lt;mutex&gt;

void foo()
{
    std::mutex mut;
    mut.lock ();                              // Violation
    // ...
    mut.unlock ();
}

#include &lt;mutex&gt;

void foo()
{
    std::mutex mut;
    std::lock_guard&lt;std::mutex&gt; lock(mut);    // OK
    // ...
} // lock_guard object is destroyed and mutex 'mut' is released
