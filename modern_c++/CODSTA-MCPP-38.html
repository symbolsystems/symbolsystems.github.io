DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Braced-initialization using {} braces is simpler and less ambiguous
than other forms of initialization. It is also safer, because it does
not allow narrowing conversions for numeric values, and it is immune
to C++'s most vexing parse.
The use of an equals sign for initialization misleads into thinking
that an assignment is taking place, even though it is not. For built-in
types like int, the difference is academic, but for user-defined types,
it is important to explicitly distinguish initialization from assignment,
because different function calls are involved." [AUTOSAR A8-5-2]

This rule detects the following cases:
- A variable is initialized without a braced initializer.
- A variable is initialized using a braced initializer, but the braces
  are preceded by the equals sign.

"If a class declares both a constructor taking std::initializer_list
argument and a constructor which invocation will be ignored in favor
of std::initializer_list constructor, this rule is not violated
by calling a constructor using () parentheses" [AUTOSAR A8-5-2]

#include &lt;initializer_list&gt;
struct S1 {
    int m1;
    S1(int i) : m1(i){}
    S1(std::initializer_list&lt;int&gt; list) : m1(1){}
};

void f1() {
    S1 s1(10);     // OK - Exception
}

This rule does not report variables declared with 'auto'
or 'decltype(auto)' specifiers, because if an initializer
of a variable of type 'auto' is enclosed in braces, then
the result of type deduction may confuse the developer
(see AUTOSAR A8-5-3).

void f1()
{
    auto c1 = [](int x){return x + 2;};    // OK - Exception
    decltype(auto) c2 = c1;                // OK - Exception
}

BENEFITS

<PRE>

This rule helps you prevent narrowing conversions of numeric values.
It also allows you to improve code clarity and avoid ambiguity.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

#include &lt;initializer_list&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;
struct S1 {
    int m1;
    S1(int i) : m1(i){}
};

void f1() {
    int i1 = 10;                   // Violation
    S1 s1(10);                     // Violation
    std::vector&lt;int&gt; v = {1,2,3};  // Violation
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

To fix the code, initialize the variables with a {} initializer that
is not preceded by the equals sign.

#include &lt;initializer_list&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;
struct S1 {
    int m1;
    S1(int i) : m1(i){}
};

void f1() {
    int i1 {10};                 // OK
    S1 s1 {10};                  // OK
    std::vector&lt;int&gt; v {1,2,3};  // OK
}
