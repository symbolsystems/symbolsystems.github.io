Avoid exit points within infinite loops [CODSTA-85-3]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"This rule applies to iterations that are meant to be non-terminating
(e.g., in a process scheduler). It should be statically provable that
the iteration cannot terminate."
The rule reports a violations if an iteration statement (while, do while, for)
has a termination point. Only loops with empty or simple constant conditions
are checked.
The rule assumes that a loop can be terminated if it contains:
- break
- return
- goto to a label outside of the loop
- throw that is not caught by try/catch inside of the loop
- calls to standard functions: exit, abort or _Exit

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule does not check called functions - if there's a termination point 
in a function called from within the loop, which is used to stop the loop,
the rule won't report a violation.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule prevents unexpected termination of loop that can not terminate.

void foo(){
    for(;;){

        break;     // Violation

    while(1){

        return;    // Violation
    }
