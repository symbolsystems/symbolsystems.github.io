DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Ensure that your class provides sensible copying, or none at all.
 The choices are:
 - If copying doesn't make sense for your type, disable copy assignment by
   declaring assignment operator as private unimplemented function
 - If copy assignment is warranted, but correct copying behaviour differs from
   what the compiler-generated version will do, then write the function yourself
   and make it non-private
 - If copying make sense and the default behaviour is correct, use the compiler
   generated version with an explicit comment, so that readers of your code
   will know that you didn't miss one of the other two options by accident"

The rule reports a violation if a class/struct does not contain neither 
explicitly declared assignment operator nor appropriate comment. The comment
should contain string 'assignment operator' which is checked insensitive.
