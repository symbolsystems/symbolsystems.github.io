Prefer composition when don't need inheritance [OOP-37-5]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Inheritance is nearly the strongest relationship we can express in C++,
it's only really appropriate when there is no equivalent weaker alternative.
"If you can express a class relationship using composition alone,
you should prefer that."
You should avoid inheritance unless you need to:
- override a virtual function
- access a protected member

BENEFITS

<PRE>

Rule improves greater flexibility, compile-time insulation, 
shorter compile times and less weirdness.

public:
    virtual int moo();
};

class DerivedB : public Base {  // Violation
public:
    virtual int virtualMoo( ) {
        publicData = 0;
