Avoid returning handles to class data from member functions [CODSTA-CPP-06-3]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"A function that returns a handle to an internal part of the object
is dangerous. It doesn't matter whether the handle is a pointer, a reference,
or an iterator. It doesn't matter whether it's qualified with const.
It doesn't matter whether the member function returning the handle
is itself const. All that matters is that a handle is being returned,
because once that's being done, you run the risk that the handle will 
outlive the object it refers to."
The rule reports a violation if a member function returns reference or pointer
to class-data.

<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Handle to class-data is:
- reference to member variable
- pointer to member variable
- pointer/reference to data allocated in constructor or deallocated in destructor
Static variables are not considered class-data.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule increases encapsulation, helps const member functions act const,
and minimizes the creation of dangling handles.

EXAMPLE

<PRE>

class Test
{
    public:
        Test(int &amp; p) : _i(p)
        {
            _k = new int; // makes data pointed by _k a "class-data"
        }
        ~Test()
        {
            if (_k) {
                delete _k;
            }
        }
        int* GetI1()
        {
            return &amp;_i; // Violation
        }
        int&amp; GetI2() const
        {
            return _i; // Violation
        }
    protected:
        const int * GetI3() const
        {
            return _k; // Violation
        }
    private:
        int &amp; _i;
        int * _k;
};
const int * ptr = 0;
class Child: public Test
{
    public:
        Child() : Test(z)
        {
        }
        void foo() const
        {
            ptr = GetI3(); // Pointer to internal object saved
        }
    private:
        int z;
};
void bar()
{
    int * i1 = 0;
    {
        Child c;
        i1 = c.GetI1(); // Pointer to internal object saved
    }
    int &amp; i2 = Child().GetI2(); // Reference to internal object saved
    // Now "ptr", "i2" and "i3" are dangling pointers/references
