Prefer initialization to assignment in constructors [INIT-14-5]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule checks constructors to see if you are assigning data members when 
you should be initializing them. 
Assigning to data members causes a default constructor to be called first, 
and then assignment will be performed later. 
Initialization eliminates the overhead of performing assignment later.
Note that constants and references can only be initialized, never assigned.
