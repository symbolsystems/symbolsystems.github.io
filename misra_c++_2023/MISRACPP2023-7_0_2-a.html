DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule reports if any type (other than bool) is converted
to bool through an implicit or explicit conversion.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Contextual conversion to bool occurs when an operand of fundamental type is
used as:
* An operand to a logical operator; or
* The first operand of the conditional operator; or
* The condition of an if-statement or iteration-statement.

The result of such a conversion may not be what the developer intended (for
example, when an assignment is accidentally used as the condition to an
if-statement). Therefore, wherever a contextual conversion to bool may occur,
the corresponding expression shall have type bool (e.g. as a result of
an explicit test)."
[MISRA C++:2023]



</PRE>
<STRONG>
EXCEPTIONS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"* A static_cast to bool is permitted for a class type having an explicit
   operator bool.
 * Contextual conversion to bool is permitted from a pointer, or from a class
   type having an explicit operator bool.
 * A bit-field of size 1 can be converted to bool â€” this is a common idiom used
   when accessing hardware registers and there is no risk of confusion.
 * In a while, a condition of the form type-specifier-seq declarator is not
   required to have type bool as alternative mechanisms for achieving the same
   effect generally require the scope of objects to be wider than necessary.
   Note that a similar exception is not needed for the if statement, as
   the if ( init-statementopt condition ) syntax was introduced in C++17."

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule helps you prevent potential errors and avoid confusion.

"Conversion from a fundamental type (see [basic.fundamental]) to bool depends
on the interpretation of a non-zero value as true (see [conv.bool]). However,
this interpretation may not be appropriate for APIs, such as POSIX, that do not
use Boolean return values."
[MISRA C++:2023]

"In addition, fundamental types, unscoped enumeration types, and pointers will
be implicitly converted on assignment to bool. The result of such implicit
conversions may not be what the developer intended."
[MISRA C++:2023]

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

struct S
{
    int b:1;
    explicit operator bool();
};

void f()
{
  int i1 = 1;
  bool b1 = i1;               // Violation
  if (i1) {}                  // Violation
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

struct S
{
    int b:1;
    explicit operator bool();
};

void f()
{
  int i1 = 1;
  bool b1 = i1 != 0;          // OK
  if (i1 != 0) {}             // OK
}


// Examples of code compliant by exception:

void f1()
{
  int* p1 = nullptr;
  if (p1) {}                  // Exception - pointer in contextual conversion

  S s;
  if (s) {}                   // Exception - explicit conversion operator
  if (s.b) {}                 // Exception - bit field
}
