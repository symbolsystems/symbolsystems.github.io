Operands of shift operators shall have an unsigned type [MISRACPP2023-7_0_4-b-2]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule reports when operands of shift operators (&lt;&lt;, &gt;&gt;) and
their compound assignment versions (&lt;&lt;=, &gt;&gt;=) do not have an unsigned
type.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
SINCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

<STRONG>
EXCEPTIONS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule does not report on the signed left-hand-side operand if:
* it is a non-negative constant of type T (before integral promotion), and
* the right-hand-side operand is also a constant in the range
  [0, sizeof(T) * CHAR_BIT - 1], and
* the shift operation does not result in "overflow".

The rule does not report on the signed right-hand-side operand
if it is a constant in the range [0, sizeof(T) * CHAR_BIT - 1],
where T is the type of the left-hand-side operand
(before integral promotion).



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule helps you avoid unexpected or undefined behavior.
The result of shift operations is only guaranteed to be defined
if the sign bit is not affected.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

void foo(signed char sc, unsigned char uc)
{
    sc &gt;&gt; 2U;       // Violation - left-hand-side operand is not unsigned
    1U &gt;&gt; sc;       // Violation - right-hand-side operand is not unsigned
    sc &gt;&gt;= (int)uc; // Violation x2 - neither of the operands is unsigned

    1 &lt;&lt; 2; // Exception - both operands are constants matching the exception
            // requirements
}

enum E : signed long
{
    U,
    V,
    W
};

void bar(E e)
{
    e &lt;&lt; 1u; // Violation - left-hand-side operand is not unsigned
}
