DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"The 'localeconv' function returns a pointer of type 'struct lconv*'. This
pointer shall be regarded as if it had type 'const struct lconv*'.
A 'struct lconv' object includes pointers of type 'char*' and the 'getenv', 
'setlocale', and 'strerror' functions each return a pointer of type 'char*'.
These pointers are used to access strings (null terminated arrays of type char).
For the purpose of this rule, these pointers shall be regarded as if they had
type 'const char*'

The Standard states that undefined behaviour occurs if a program modifies:
- The structure pointed to by the value returned by 'localeconv';
- The strings returned by 'getenv', 'setlocale' or 'strerror'.

The Standard does not specify the behaviour that results if the strings
referenced by the structure pointed to by the value returned by 'localeconv'
are modified. This rule prohibits any changes to these strings as they are 
considered to be undesirable." [MISRA C:2012 Amendment 1 Rule 21.19]

This rule detects the following cases:
- the pointers returned by the functions 'localeconv', 'getenv', 'setlocale'
or 'strerror' are assigned to pointers to non-const-qualified types,
- the members of the structure 'lconv' referenced by the function 'localeconv'
are assigned to pointers to non-const-qualified types.

"If a modified version is required, a program should make and modify a copy
of any value covered by this rule." [MISRA C:2012 Amendment 1 Rule 21.19]

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Treating the pointers returned by the various functions as if they were 
const-qualified allows an analysis tool to detect any attempt to modify an
object through one of the pointers. Additionally, assigning the return values
of the functions to const-qualified pointers will result in the compiler 
issuing a diagnostic if an attempt is made to modify an object."
[MISRA C:2012 Amendment 1 Rule 21.19]
