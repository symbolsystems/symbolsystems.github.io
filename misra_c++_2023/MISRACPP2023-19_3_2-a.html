DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"The order of evaluation associated with multiple #, multiple ## or a mix
of # and ## preprocessor operators is unspecified. In particular, the result of
a # operator is a string literal and it is extremely unlikely that pasting this
to any other preprocessing token will result in a valid token."

This rule detects macro parameters immediately following a # operator that are
immediately followed by a ## operator.

BENEFITS
