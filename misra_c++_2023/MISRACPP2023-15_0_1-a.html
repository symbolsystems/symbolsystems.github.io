DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule reports when a class does not implement the following
requirements:

"A class shall belong to exactly one of the following categories
(other combinations are not permitted):
* Unmovable - it is not copy-constructible, not move-constructible,
  not copy-assignable and not move-assignable; or
* Move-only - it is move-constructible (and optionally move-assignable)
  but neither copy-constructible nor copy-assignable; or
* Copy-enabled â€” it is copy-constructible and move-constructible and
  can optionally also be both copy-assignable and move-assignable.
   
If a class has customized copy or move operations, it shall have a
customized destructor.

A class with a customized destructor [...]:
* If the class is move-only, it shall have a customized move constructor.
  If it is move-assignable, it shall also have a customized move
  assignment operator. [...]
* If the class is copy-enabled, it shall have a customized copy
  constructor and its move constructor shall either be customized or
  not declared. If it is copy-assignable, it shall also have a customized
  copy-assignment operator and the move operations shall either both
  be customized or both not be declared. [...]
   
A class that is used as a public base class shall either:
1. Be an unmovable class that has a (possibly inherited) public virtual
   destructor; or
2. Have a protected non-virtual destructor.
Note: these destructors shall either be defined as =default or customized."

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"For the purposes of this rule, a special member function is said to be
customized if it is user-provided and not defaulted."
[MISRA C++:2023]



</PRE>
<STRONG>
EXCEPTIONS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"An aggregate, which cannot have a user-declared destructor, may be
used as a public base class." [MISRA C++:2023]

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule helps you avoid confusion about the semantics of the
implicitly generated special member functions. It also ensures
consistency in providing customized functions.

EXAMPLE

<PRE>

class C { // Violation - neither unmovable, move-only, nor copy-enabled
public:
    C&amp; operator=(const C&amp;) = default;
    C&amp; operator=(C&amp;&amp;) = default;
    C(const C&amp;) = delete;
    C(C&amp;&amp;) = delete;
};

class B { // Violation - base class without customized destructor
public:
    B();
private:
    int* ptr;
};

class D: public B
{
public:
    D();
};

struct S { // Violation - move-only class with destructor and without
           //             customized move constructor
    S(S&amp;&amp;) = default;
    S&amp; operator=(S&amp;&amp;) = delete;
    S(const S&amp;) = delete;
    S&amp; operator=(const S&amp;) = delete;
    ~S();
};
