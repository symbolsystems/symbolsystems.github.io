DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Don't try to play with object lifetime by calling the destructor manually.
After you call an object's destructor, its lifetime is over and it is undefined
and generally unsafe to do anything with it."

The rule reports violations on explicit calls of destructors.

<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

class A {
public:
    A();
    ~A();
};

void foo( ) {
    A obj;
    obj.~A( );        // Violation
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
