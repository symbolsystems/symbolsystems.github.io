DESCRIPTION

<PRE>

"Throw an exception across an execution boundary only when both sides of
the execution boundary use the same ABI for exception handling."
[CERT-ERR59-CPP]

"An execution boundary is the delimitation between code compiled by differing
compilers. . . For instance, a function may be declared in a header file but
defined in a library that is loaded at runtime. The execution boundary exists
between the call site in the executable and the function implementation in
the library. Such boundaries are also called ABI." [CERT-ERR59-CPP]

If your application calls a function that is defined in an external library,
the library and the application may be compiled with different compilers.

This rule detects when the 'try' block contains a call to a function that can
throw exceptions and is defined in an external library.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule assumes that a function is defined in a library that can be
compiled with a different compiler than the application is compiled with
when a) the function is declared in a header outside of the testing project
and b) the definition of the function is not available in the translation unit
that contains a call to this function.

This rule should only be applied when both sides of the execution boundary
use different ABI for exception handling.

The rule analyzes declarations and definitions in files in the testing scope.
For this reason, the set of findings reported for the same file may vary
depending on the scope of analysis.

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule helps you prevent abnormal program execution when the library
and the application adhere to different ABIs.

// lib.h
void foo() throw(int);

// file.cpp
#include "lib.h"

void goo() {
    try {
        foo();                       // Violation
    } catch (int &amp;e) {
    }
