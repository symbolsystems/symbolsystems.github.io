DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"The value of an expression of floating type shall
not be implicitly converted to a different type if:
a) it is not a conversion to a wider floating type, or
b) the expression is complex, or
c) the expression is a function argument, or
d) the expression is a return expression."
[MISRA C:2004 Rule 10.2]

This rule detects cases when the floating point number is assigned
to an object with a narrower 'underlying type'.

"The term 'underlying type' is defined as describing the type that would
be obtained from evaluating an expression if it were not for the effects
of integral promotion." [MISRA C:2004 Rule 10.1]

The complete definition of the 'underlying type' is described
by the MISRA C:2004 (6.10.4 Underlying type) and the MISRA C++:2008
(6.5 Expressions - Underlying type) standards.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The following operations are covered by this rule:
- Assignment by means of one of the assignment operators;
- Passing an argument to a function, in which case the argument is copied as 
  if by assignment to the corresponding parameter;
- Returning an expression from a function, in which case the result is copied
  as if by assignment to an object with the function's return type;
- Using an expression to initialize all or part of an object, including a 
  compound literal in C99, in which case the expression is copied as if by 
  assignment to the destination;
- The conversion of the constant expression in a switch statement's case label
  to the promoted type of the controlling expression.

BENEFITS

"An implicit conversion that results in the size of a type being reduced
may result in a loss of information." [MISRA C++:2008 Rule 5-0-6]

EXAMPLE

<PRE>

void bar(double f);

float foo(double d)
{
    float f1 = 0.0;   // Violation
    f1 = 1.23;        // Violation
    bar(2.0L);        // Violation
    return -121.13;   // Violation
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

void bar(double f);

double foo(double d)
{
    float f1 = 0.0F;  // OK - suffix 'F' was added 
    f1 = (float)1.23; // OK - explicit cast to float was added
    bar(2.0);         // OK - unnecessary suffix was removed
    return -121.13;   // OK - function's return type was changed to double
}
