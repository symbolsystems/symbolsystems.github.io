DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"The operand of typeid operator is evaluated only if it is a function call which
returns a reference to a polymorphic type.
Providing side effects to typeid operator, which takes place only under special
circumstances, makes the code more difficult to maintain." [AUTOSAR A5-3-1]

"Accessing an object designated by a volatile lvalue), modifying an object,
calling a library I/O function, or calling a function that does any of those
operations are all side effects, which are changes in the state of the execution
environment." [ISO/IEC 14882:1998]

This rule detects when one of the following operators is used as the operand of
the 'typeid' operator:
- assignment
- increment
- decrement
- new
- delete
- throw

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

In the following example, the operands of the 'typeid' operators are
increment operators.

#include &lt;typeinfo&gt;

void f1() {
    int var;
    typeid(var++);     // Violation
    typeid(var += 5);  // Violation
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

To fix the code, use an already incremented variable as the operand
of the 'typeid' operators.

#include &lt;typeinfo&gt;

void f1() {
    int var;
    var++;
    typeid(var);      // OK
    var += 5;
    typeid(var);      // OK
}

1. AUTOSAR C++14 Coding Guidelines
   A5-3-1. Evaluation of the operand to the typeid operator shall not contain
   side effects.

2. High Integrity C++ Coding Standard
   5.1.6. Do not code side effects into the right-hand operands of: &amp;&amp;, ||,
