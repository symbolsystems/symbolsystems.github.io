For associative containers never use comparison function returning true for equal values [CERT_CPP-CTR57-a-3]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Create a set where less_equal is the comparison type, then insert 10 into the
set:
set&lt;int, less_equal&lt;int&gt; &gt; s;
s.insert(10); 
s.insert(10); // Now try inserting 10 again:

For this call to insert, the set has to figure out whether 10 is already
present. To make it easier to understand what happens when the set does this,
we'll call the 10 that was initially inserted 10A and the 10 that we're trying
to insert 10B. The set runs through its internal data structures looking for
the place to insert 10B. It ultimately has to check 10B to see if it's the same
as 10A. The definition of "the same" for associative containers is equivalence,
so the set tests to see whether 10B is equivalent to 10A. When performing this
test, it naturally uses the set's comparison function. In this example, that's
operator&lt;=, because we specified less_equal as the set's comparison function,
and less_equal means operators. The set thus checks to see whether this 
expression is true:

!(10A&lt;= 10B)&amp;&amp;!(10B&lt;= 10A) // test 10A and 10B for equivalence

Well, 10A and 10B are both 10, so it's clearly true that 10A &lt;= 10B. Equally
clearly, 10B &lt;= 10A. The above expression thus simplifies to !(true)&amp;&amp;!(true)
and that simplifies to false &amp;&amp; false which is simply false. That is, the set
concludes that 10A and 10B are not equivalent, hence not the same, and it thus
goes about inserting 10B into the container alongside 10A. Technically, this
action yields undefined behavior, but the nearly universal outcome is that the
set ends up with two copies of the value 10, and that means it's not a set any
longer."

"By using less_equal as our comparison type, we've corrupted the container!
Furthermore, any comparison function where equal values return true will do
the same thing. Equal values are, by definition, not equivalent!"
