DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"If you've passed an array of derived class objects to base class pointer,
your compilers are probably wrong. In that case, they'd assume each object
in the array is the size of a base class, but each object would actually
be the size of a derived class. Derived classes usually have more data members
than their base classes, so derived class objects are usually larger than base
class objects. If it is, the pointer arithmetic to base class will be wrong
for arrays of derived class objects.
The problem pops up in a different guise if you try to delete an array
of derived class objects through a base class pointer.
The 'language specification' says the result of deleting an array of derived
class objects through a base class pointer is undefined, but we know what that
really means: executing the code is almost certain to lead to grief.
Polymorphism and pointer arithmetic simply don't mix. Array operations almost
always involve pointer arithmetic, so arrays and polymorphism don't mix."

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule checks only direct conversions. If a pointer to an array of derived 
class objects is first converted to a pointer to derived class object and later
to base class object, then violation is not reported.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule prevents unexpected and undefined behaviours.

<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

class A {
public:
    A();
    int i;
};

class B : public A {
public:
    B();
    int i;
    int j;
};

void b1(A* a);

void foo1(){
    A* ap = new B[3];          // Violation
    B bt[5];
	
    ap = bt;                   // Violation
    ap = static_cast&lt;A*&gt;(bt);  // Violation
	
    b1(bt);                    // Violation
}

void foo2(){
    B* bp = new B[3];
    A* ap = bp;          // No Violation - not direct conversion
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Do not convert an array of derived class objects to base class pointer.
