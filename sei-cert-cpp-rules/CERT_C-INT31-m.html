DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Restricting implicit conversions on composite expressions means that sequences
of arithmetic operations within an expression must be conducted in the same
essential type, with the exception that essentially real floating and
essentially complex floating operations may coexist. This reduces possible
developer confusion.

The expression u32a + u16b + u16c is compliant as both additions will notionally
be performed in type uint32_t. In this case only non-composite expressions are
implicitly converted.

The expression (u16a + u16b) + u32c is non-compliant as the left addition is
notionally performed in type uint16_t and the right in type uint32_t, requiring
an implicit conversion of the composite expression u16a + u16b to uint32_t."
[MISRA C:2012 Rule 10.7 with Amendment 3]

The rule reports a violation on a complex expression if:
- the usual arithmetic conversions are performed on its operands, and
- a composite expression is used as one operand and the other operand
  has wider essential type

The terms "composite expression" and "essential type" are defined
by the MISRA C:2012 standard.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule does not check operands of a conditional operator (?:).
This operator is checked in rule CODSTA-156_b.

BENEFITS

<PRE>

The rule reduces possible developer confusion.
