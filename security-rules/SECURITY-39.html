<STRONG>
Use secure temporary file name functions [SECURITY-39-3]
</STRONG>
<BR><BR>

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule reports a violation when an insecure function that generates
a pathname that may be used for a temporary file:
    mktemp, tempnam, tmpnam, tmpnam_r, tmpnam_s

These functions only create pathnames. It is the application's responsibility
to create and remove the files. Between when a pathname is created and the
file is opened, it is possible for another process to create a file with the
same name.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
SINCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

v9.5



</PRE>
<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

There are additional issues related to those functions:

1. tmpnam has implementation-defined behavior if called more than TMP_MAX times
   in a single process. 

2. tmpnam, when called with null pointer, returns a string that points to an
   internal static buffer that will be overwritten by subsequent calls from the
   same process.

3. tmpnam_r is a function proposed in a POSIX draft and implemented by few
   systems. It uses tmpnam internally and has the same security issues.

4. tmpnam_s is a slightly improved variant implemented on Windows. It has the
   same security issues as tmpnam.

5. tempnam in some implementations uses tmpnam internally and has the same
   security issues.

6. tempnam is marked obsolescent since Issue 7 of The Open Group Base
   Specifications (POSIX) and may be removed in future versions.

7. mktemp is removed from The Open Group Base Specifications (POSIX) since
   Issue 7.

8. mktemp follows 4.3BSD in some implementations and creates a pathname with the
   current process ID and a single letter. As a result, up to 26 different names
   can be returned.

Consider using functions that open files instead of only creating pathname:
tmpfile, mkstemp, mkdtemp

<PRE>

Detects uses of selected functions with known security issues related to
creation of temporary file names.

EXAMPLE

<PRE>

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
char filename[L_tmpnam + 1];
static FILE * foo()
{
    /* Use of tmpnam is not recommended: */
    tmpnam(filename);       /* Violation */
    return fopen(filename, "w");
}

REPAIR

<PRE>

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
static FILE * foo()
{
    /* Consider using functions without such security issues: */
    return tmpfile();
