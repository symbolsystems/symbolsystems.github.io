DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"The problems arise when programmers think about inserting objects into
containers, but don't tell the STL what they're thinking. Here's a common way
this can manifest itself:

 vector&lt;int&gt; values;
 vector&lt;int&gt; results;
 transform( values.begin(), values.end(), results.end(), transmogrify);

In this example, transform is told that the beginning of its destination range
is results.end(), so that's where it starts writing the results of invoking
transmogrify on every element of values. Like every algorithm that uses a
destination range, transform writes its results by making assignments to the
elements in the destination range, transform will thus apply transmogrify to
values[0] and assign the result to *results.end(). It will then apply
transmogrify to values[1] and assign the result to *(results.end()+1). The call
to transform is wrong, because it's asking for assignments to be made to
objects that don't exist. (...) the way to say "please put transform's results
at the end of the container called results" is to call back_inserter to
generate the iterator specifying the beginning of the destination range."

BENEFITS

"This can lead only to disaster, because there is no object at *results.end(),
much less at *(results.end()+1)! The call to transform is wrong, because it's
asking for assignments to be made to objects that don't exist."
