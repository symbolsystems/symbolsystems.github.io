DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"(...) unary_function and binary_function are templates, so you can't inherit
from them directly. Instead, you must inherit from structs they generate, and
that requires that you specify some type arguments. For unary_function, you
must specify the type of parameter taken by your functor class's operator(),
as well as its return type. For binary_function, you specify three types: the
types of your operator's first and second parameters, and your operator's 
return type. Let's not forget the fundamental reason for all this
unary_function and binary_function base class gobbledegook. These classes
supply typedefs that are required by function object adapters, so inheritance
from those classes yields adaptable function objects."

STL function objects are modeled on C++ functions, and a C++ function has only
one set of parameter types and one return type. As a result, the STL
implicitly assumes that each functor class has only one operator() function,
and it's the parameter and return types for this function that should be passed
to unary_function or binary_function. This means that, tempting though it might
be, you shouldn't try to combine the functionality of WidgetNameCompare and
PtrWidgetNameCompare by creating a single struct with two operator() functions.
If you did, the functor would be adaptable with respect to at most one of its
calling forms, and a functor that's adaptable only half the time might just as
well not be adaptable at all."

"Adaptability is important, and you should strive to facilitate it each time
you write a functor class."
