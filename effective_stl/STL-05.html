DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"(...) almost all uses of copy where the destination range is specified using
an insert iterator (i.e.. via inserter, back_inserter. or front_inserter) can
be — should be — replaced with calls to range member functions. Too many STL
programmers overuse copy, so the advice I just gave bears repeating: Almost all
uses of copy where the destination range is specified using an insert iterator
should be replaced with calls to range member functions."

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"In short, range member functions yield code that is easier to write and
easier to understand. (...) It would be helpful to have a more universally
agreed-upon criterion for establishing the superiority of range member
functions to their single-element counterparts. For the standard sequence
containers, we have one: efficiency. When dealing with the standard sequence
containers, application of single-element member functions makes more demands
on memory allocators, copies objects more frequently, and/or performs redundant
operations compared to range member functions that achieve the same end."

    v1.clear();
    copy(v2.begin() + v2.size() / 2, v2.end(), back_inserter(v1 )); // Violation
