DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"The minute you decide to use 'new' for a dynamic allocation, you adopt
the following responsibilities:
1. You must make sure that somebody will later delete the allocation.
2. You must ensure that the correct form of delete is used. For
  an allocation of a single object, "delete" must be used.
  For an array allocation, "delete []" is required.
3. You must make sure that delete is used exactly once.
Any time you find yourself getting ready to dynamically allocate an array, you
should consider using a vector or a string instead. . . [Vectors and strings]
eliminate the burdens above, because they manage their own memory."
[Effective STL]

This rule detects when a 'new' operator that dynamically allocates an array
is used in code.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule helps you improve code maintainability and avoid potential problems
that may occur when the dynamic allocation of arrays is incorrectly performed.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

#include &lt;vector&gt;
using namespace std;

class A{};
void foo()
{
    A *p;
    p = new A[10];           // Violation
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

You can fix the code by replacing the dynamically allocated array by a string
or a vector.

#include &lt;vector&gt;
using namespace std;

class A{};

void foo()
{
    A obj;
    vector &lt;A&gt; vectorA;      // OK
    vectorA.push_back(obj);
}
