DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Given the inevitability of having to change container types from time to time,
you can facilitate such changes in the usual manner: by encapsulating,
encapsulating, encapsulating. One of the easiest ways to do this is through the
liberal use of typedefs for container and iterator types.(...) A typedef is
just a synonym for some other type, so the encapsulation it affords is purely
lexical. A typedef doesn't prevent a client from doing (or depending on)
anything they couldn't already do (or depend on). You need bigger ammunition
if you want to limit client exposure to the container choices you've made. 
You need classes. To limit the code that may require modification if you 
replace one container type with another, hide the container in a class, and
limit the amount of container-specific information visible through the class 
interface. For example, if you need to create a customer list, don't use a
list directly. Instead, create a CustomerList class, and hide a list in its 
private section"

"When you consider this kind of change, you still have to check every
CustomerList member function and every friend to see how they'll be affected
(in terms of performance and iterator/pointer/reference invalidation, etc.),
but if you've done a good job of encapsulating CustomerList's implementation
details, the impact on CustomerList clients should be small. You can't write
container-independent code, but they might be able to."
