Design functor classes for pass-by-value [STL-28-3]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Because function objects are passed and returned by value, the onus is on you
to make sure that your function objects behave well when passed that way
(i.e., copied). This implies two things. First, your function objects need to
be small. Otherwise they will be too expensive to copy. Second, your function
objects must be monomorphic (i.e., not polymorphic) â€” they must not use
virtual functions. That's because derived class objects passed by value into
parameters of base class type suffer from the slicing problem: during the copy,
their derived parts are removed. The prohibition on polymorphic functors is
equally unrealistic. Surely there's a way to let function objects be big
and/or polymorphic, yet still allow them to mesh with the pass-functors-by-
value convention that pervades the STL. There is. Take the data and/or the
polymorphism you'd like to put in your functor class, and move it into a
different class. Then give your functor class a pointer to this new class."

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

By small class functor rule means the one with the number of non-static
members not exceeding 5.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Rule prevents the slicing problem and expensive copying.

// compiles with msvc 6.0, 7.1

    Widget w;
    int x;
    int y;
    void someFunction();
    bool checkWidget(Widget &amp;);
    
public:
