DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"The 'notify_one()' member function unblocks one of the threads that are blocked
on the specified condition variable at the time of the call. If multiple threads
are waiting on the same condition variable, the scheduler can select any of
those threads to be awakened (assuming that all threads have the same priority
level). The 'notify_all()' member function unblocks all of the threads that are
blocked on the specified condition variable at the time of the call."
[CERT-CON55-CPP]

"The use of 'notify_one()' is safe if each thread uses a unique condition
variable. If multiple threads share a condition variable, the use of
'notify_one()' is safe only if the following conditions are met:
- All threads must perform the same set of operations after waking up, which
  means that any thread can be selected to wake up and resume for a single
  invocation of 'notify_one()'.
- Only one thread is required to wake upon receiving the signal.
The 'notify_all()' function can be used to unblock all of the threads
that are blocked on the specified condition variable if the use of
'notify_one()' is unsafe." [CERT-CON55-CPP]

This rule detects when the 'notify_one()' function is called on a global
condition variable. If multiple threads share the same condition variable,
the 'liveness' property may be violated.

The compliant solution is to use the 'notify_all()' function, or to ensure
that a unique condition variable is used for each thread.

This rule helps you preserve the liveness when using condition variables.
"The liveness property requires that every operation or function invocation
execute to completion without interruption; for example, there is no deadlock."
