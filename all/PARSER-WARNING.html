DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule reports "warning" severity level parser diagnostics.

Warnings indicate that the code is valid but the parser detected something
questionable.

<PRE>
v10.1

<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule reports various kinds of violations. Each kind is identified
with a numeric ID.

For example:
  void bar(int i) // Violation W-552: parameter "i" was set but never used
  {
    if (i = 10); // Violation W-189: use of "=" where "==" may have been intended
  }

The rule can be customized to disable or enable only some violations. 

By default all possible violations are enabled.

To disable violations with ID 71, 551, 552 use following properties file entry:
PARSER-WARNING-config=-71,551,552

The minus "-" at the beginning means "disable". Violation IDs are separated by
a comma ",".

To disable all violations except violation 179 and 189 use following properties
file entry:
PARSER-WARNING-config=-*;+179,189

The asterisk "*" means "all IDs". The semicolon ";" is used to separate the
"disable" group of IDs (the first group prefixed with a "-", consisting of "*")
and the "enable" group of IDs (consisting of IDs 179 and 189). So the above 
can be read as "disable all; then enable 179, 189".

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Parse warnings can detect possible bugs. Writing warning-free code leads to
a better and safer code.

<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Here is an example that will trigger a violation:

int foo()
{
    int z;

    // W-71: integer conversion resulted in truncation
    // W-179: variable "c" was declared but never referenced
    char c = 1024;      // Violation

    // W-551: variable "z" is used before its value is set
    return z;           // Violation
}
