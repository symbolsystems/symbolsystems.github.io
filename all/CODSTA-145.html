Use of possibly not null-terminated string with functions expecting null-terminated string [CODSTA-145-3]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Traditionally, strings are represented as a region of memory containing 
data terminated with a NULL character. Older string-handling methods frequently
rely on this NULL character to determine the length of the string. If a buffer
that does not contain a NULL terminator is passed to one of these functions,
the function will read past the end of the buffer." [CWE-170]

This rule reports a violation if it detects that:
* a buffer was created by a function which is known to create not
  null-terminated buffers (for example 'readlink', 'read', 'fread'), and
* the buffer was passed to a function which is known to expect a null-terminated
  buffer (for example 'strlen', 'strcpy', 'rename'), and
* the buffer was not used between those two calls, and
* the buffer was not initialized by null characters '\0'

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

1. The rule does not report a violations if it detects that the buffer might be
   modified or checked between the calls:

   void doSth(char*);
   void foo1(const char* path, char* buf, int n) {
      readlink(path, buf, n);           // not reported
      doSth(buf);                       // use detected
      strlen(buf);         
   }

2. If the buffer is a complex expression, then the rule does not report the
   violation if any part of the expression is used:

   struct S {
      char buf1[10];
      char buf2[10];
   };
   void doSth(char*);
   void foo2(const char* path, struct S* sptr, int n) {
      readlink(path, sptr-&gt;buf1, n); // not reported
      doSth(sptr-&gt;buf2);    // detected use of "sptr" - it is also part of the
      strlen(sptr-&gt;buf1);   // "sptr-&gt;buf1" expression
   }

3. Control flow is ignored, the rule only compares line/column numbers:

   void foo3(const char* path, char* buf, int n, int i) {
      if (i) {
         readlink(path, buf, n); // Violation reported
      } else {
         strlen(buf);  // strlen(buf) called after readlink(..., buf, ...)
                       // and 'buf' not used between the calls
      }
   }

4. The rule supports only identical buffer expressions:

   void foo4(const char* path, char* buf, int n) {  
      readlink(path, buf + 10, n); // not reported - different expressions
      strlen(buf + 5 + 5); // "buf+5+5" is different than "buf+10"
   }

5. The violation might be not reported if the buffer and the function expecting
   null-terminated string are used as part of one expression:

   void doSth(size_t, char*);
   char* foo5(const char* path, char* buf, int n) {
      readlink(path, buf, n);  // not reported 
      doSth(strlen(buf), buf); // 'buf' and 'strlen(buf)' used in the same
                               // expression

      readlink(path, buf, n);  // not reported 
      return strlen(buf) + buf;// 'buf' and 'strlen(buf)' used in the same
                               // expression
   }

6. The rule assumes that a local buffer is correctly terminated when the whole
   buffer is initialized by null characters '\0' and the size of the buffer
   is determined by the expression 'sizeof(buf) - 1' in the 'readlink'
   (or similar) function call.

   void foo6(const char *path) {
      char buf[10] = {'\0'};   // initialized by '\0'
      int length;
      readlink(path, buf, sizeof(buf) - 1);  // not reported
      //...
      length = strlen(buf);  // 'buf' is correctly null terminated
   }

BENEFITS

<PRE>

"If a null character is omitted from a string, then most string-copying functions
will read data until they locate a null character, even outside of the intended
boundaries of the string. This could:
 - cause a crash due to a segmentation fault
 - cause sensitive adjacent memory to be copied and sent to an outsider
 - trigger a buffer overflow when the copy is being written to a fixed-size
   buffer" [CWE-170]
