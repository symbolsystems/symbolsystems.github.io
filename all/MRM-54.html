DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Although the global operator 'new', the default allocation function invoked
by the 'new' expression, is specified by the C++ standard [ISO/IEC 14882-2014]
to allocate sufficient storage suitably aligned to represent any object of
the specified size, since the expected alignment isn't part of the function's
interface, the most a program can safely assume is that the storage allocated
by the default operator new defined by the implementation is aligned for
an object with a fundamental alignment. In particular, it is unsafe to use
the storage for an object of a type with a stricter alignment requirement
an over-aligned type." [CERT-MEM57-CPP]

This rule detects when a default operator 'new' or an overloaded global
operator 'new' is used for an over-aligned type. The compliant solution is
to use an overloaded member operator 'new'.
This rule assumes that an over-aligned type is a type whose declaration
contains the 'alignas' specifier.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Avoid relying on the default operator 'new' to obtain storage for objects
of over-aligned types. Doing so may result in an object being constructed
at a misaligned location, which has undefined behavior and can result
in abnormal termination when the object is accessed, even on architectures
otherwise known to tolerate misaligned accesses." [CERT-MEM57-CPP]

This rule helps you prevent undefined behavior that can lead to abnormal
termination.
