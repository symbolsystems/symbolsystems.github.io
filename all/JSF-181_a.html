Redundant explicit casts will not be used [JSF-181_a-3]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Explicit casting between identical types is unnecessary and clutters code.
Furthermore it can mask problems if changes are made to the code (e.g. one of 
the types changes and a conversion with possible loss of information occurs)"

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"The use of casting should be sufficient to cause the calculations required 
to occur with the desired precision. Unnecessary casting adds the possibility
of confusion, and may be such that its interaction with the rules of promotion
leads to results other than those expected. Unnecessary casting may also lead
to code which is harder to maintain, should the types of variables change."

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

typedef int INT;

int someFunction1();
INT someFunction2();

void foo(int p)
{
    /* ... */
    p = (int)someFunction1();  // Violation
    p = (int)someFunction2();  // Violation
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

typedef int INT;

int someFunction1();
INT someFunction2();

void foo(int p)
{
    /* ... */
    p = someFunction1();  // OK
    p = someFunction2();  // OK
}
