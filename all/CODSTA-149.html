Missing break statement between cases in a switch statement [CODSTA-149-3]
</STRONG>
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>
DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

A switch statement consists of several 'case' labels, plus an optional 'default'
label. A series of statements following those labels conventionally ends with
a break statement; if omitted, control flow falls through to the next label in
the switch statement block. Because the break statement is not required,
omitting it does not produce compiler diagnostics. If the omission was
unintentional, it can result in an unexpected control flow.

This rule reports a violation if there is no statement which would break
the control flow between case or default labels. The following statements
are recognized as breaking the control flow:
- break, return
- exit(), abort(), _Exit()
- continue, goto, throw (if those statements cause control flow to jump out
  of the switch label)

The rule also recognizes a "fall through" comment placed at the end of the case.
The regular expression recognized is: falls?.?thro?u (ignoring case).
(e.g. following comments are acceptable: 'falls through', 'fall through',
 'fall thru', 'FALLS THROUGH', 'FALL THRU')

No violation is reported on the last label.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule does not require the statement which breaks the control flow to be
placed unconditionally at the end of the case/default statements.

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Following this rule helps prevent logic errors and unexpected application
behavior.

// Example of code which results in a rule violation:
int foo(int i, int j)
{
    int x;
    switch (i)
    {
        case 1:                  // Violation - missing break
            x = i + 1;
        case 2:                  // Violation - missing break
            x = i + 2;
        case 3:                  // Violation - missing break
            x = i + 3;
        default:                 // Violation - missing break
            x = 0;
