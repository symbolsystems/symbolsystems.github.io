DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Identifiers declared in the same scope and name space shall be distinct.
The definition of distinct depends on the implementation and on the version
of the C language that is being used. In C99 the minimum requirement is that
the first 63 characters are significant." [MISRA C:2012 Rule 5.2]

This rule detects cases when identifiers declared in the file scope
and in the same name space have the same first 63 characters of their names.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Long identifiers may impair the readability of code. While many automatic code
generation systems produce long identifiers, there is a good argument for
keeping identifier lengths well below this limit." [MISRA C:2012 Rule 5.2]

"There are separate name spaces for various categories of identifiers,
 as follows:
- label names (disambiguated by the syntax of the label declaration and use);
- the tags of structures, unions, and enumerations (disambiguated by following
  any) of the keywords struct, union, or enum);
- the members of structures or unions; each structure or union has a separate
  name space for its members (disambiguated by the type of the expression used
  to access the member via the . or -&gt; operator);
- all other identifiers, called ordinary identifiers (declared in ordinary
  declarators or as enumeration constants)." [ISO/IEC 9899:1999]

<STRONG>
EXCEPTIONS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"This rule does not apply if both identifiers are external identifiers
because this case is covered by Rule 5.1.
This rule does not apply if either identifier is a macro identifier because
this case is covered by Rule 5.4 and Rule 5.5." [MISRA C:2012 Rule 5.2]



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"If two identifiers differ only in non-significant characters, the behaviour is
undefined. If portability is a concern, it would be prudent to apply this rule
using the minimum limits specified in The Standard." [MISRA C:2012 Rule 5.2]
