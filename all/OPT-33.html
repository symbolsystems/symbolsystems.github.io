DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule reports a violation if an object of type class/struct/union
is returned from function by value. In this case could consider
returning this object by reference. It could more efficient than returning
by value, however could be unsafe in some cases. So, the user should check
himself the definition of function before the changes, to be sure that a new 
code is safe and more efficient than previous one.
