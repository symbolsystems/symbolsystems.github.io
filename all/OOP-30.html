DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"It's possible to move the link-time error up to compile time (always a good
thing — earlier error detection is better than later) by declaring the copy
constructor and copy assignment operator private not in class itself,
but in a base class specifically designed to prevent copying.
This works, because compilers will try to generate a copy constructor
and a copy assignment operator if anybody — even a member or friend
function — tries to copy a class object."

BENEFITS

<PRE>

"The compiler-generated versions of these functions will try
to call their base class counterparts, and those calls will be
rejected, because the copying operations are private in the
base class."
