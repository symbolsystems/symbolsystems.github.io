Declare copy constructor and copy assignment operators with the 'delete' specifier to prevent copying of class [CODSTA-MCPP-06_a-3]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

One of the ways to make a class uncopyable is to make its copy constructor and
copy assignment operators private, with no implementation. This moves subtle
run-time bugs into compile- or link- time. In C++11, we can now explicitly
declare a class with deleted functions.

This rule detects cases when the private undefined copy constructors or copy
assignment operators are declared without the 'delete' specifier.
