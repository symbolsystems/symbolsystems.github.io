Report Cyclomatic Complexity [METRICS-29-5]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule reports the Cyclomatic Complexity value for each function definition
except non-instantiated template functions.

Cyclomatic Complexity is calculated according to the formula:
CC = Number of decisions + 1
By decision we mean every occurrence of:
-'if'
-'for'
-'while'
-'do-while'
-'case'
-'catch'
-conditional expression 'a?b:c'
-logical operator '&amp;&amp;' and '||'

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

To change the default limit of the Cyclomatic Complexity modify the main
"Count" expression of the rule (Collector A) from "$$ &gt; 0" to "$$ &gt; N"
using desired threshold value for N. Rule's header should be also changed
accordingly.

To ignore switch statements in the computation of the Cyclomatic Complexity,
modify the "Count" expression for the cases (Collector C) from "$$ &gt; 0"
to "$$ == 0".

To ignore switch statements having more than N cases in the computation
of the Cyclomatic Complexity, modify the "Count" expression for the cases
(Collector C) from "$$ &gt; 0" to "$$ &lt;= N" using desired threshold value for N.

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Studies have found that methods with high Cyclomatic Complexity are error-prone.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

void foo(int a, int b) // Violation - CC value: 8
{
    if(a||b)           // 1, 2
    {
    }
    if((a||b)&amp;&amp;(a&amp;&amp;b)) // 3, 4, 5, 6
    {
    }
    do                 // 7
    {
    }while(0);
}
