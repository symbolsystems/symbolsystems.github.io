DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

If a parameter uses the same name as member variable, then it hides
this variable, what may lead to developer confusion.

The rule reports a violation if a parameter declared in a definition
of member function uses the same name as member variable of current class
or as public/protected member variable of base class.

class Base {
public:
    int basem;
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void foo1(int basem){}     // Violation
    void foo2(int member);     // OK - reported on definition
private:
    int member;
};

void Derived::foo2(int member){ // Violation
    member = 10;                // possible mistake
}

};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
