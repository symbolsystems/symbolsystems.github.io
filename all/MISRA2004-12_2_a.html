DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Apart from a few operators (notably the function call operator (), &amp;&amp;, ||, ?:
and , (comma)) the order in which sub-expressions are evaluated is unspecified
and can vary. This means that no reliance can be placed on the order of
evaluation of sub-expressions, and in particular no reliance can be placed on
the order in which side effects occur."

Since the increment/decrement operator modifies its operand, use of such
operand more than once within the same expression can cause undefined results.
If an object is modified in expression, then the prior value shall be read only 
to determine the value to be stored. Otherwise the behaviour is undefined.

The rule reports a violation if an object is modified (incremented,
decremented or assigned) and used in any other way in expression,
where the order of evaluation of sub-expressions is unspecified.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"The use of increment and decrement operators in combination with other 
arithmetic operators is not recommended. When the increment or decrement
operator is used, it should be the only side-effect in the statement."

"Assignments nested within expressions cause additional side effects. The best 
way to avoid any chance of this leading to a dependence on order of evaluation 
is to not embed assignments within expressions."

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule prevents writing expressions that can produce different values 
depending on order of evaluation that the standard permits.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

void foo1(int i) 
{
    int x;
    int b[10];

    x = b[i] + i++; // Violation - This will give different results depending
                    // on whether b[i] is evaluated before i++ or vice versa.
}

int foo_m(int);
void foo2(){
    int x;
    int y;
    int* p;

    y = ++x + x;        // Violation
    y = x + foo_m(x++); // Violation
    y = x + (x = 1);    // Violation
    *p = *p++;          // Violation
}

REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

void foo1(int i) 
{
    int x;
    int b[10];

    x = b[i] + i;   // OK - The problem could be avoided by putting
    i++;            // the increment operation in a separate statement.
}

int foo_m(int);
void foo2(){
    int x, y;
    int* p;
	
    ++x;
    y = x + x;        // OK
    y = x + foo_m(x); // OK
    *(p+1) = *p;      // OK
    p++;

    y = ++x &amp;&amp; x;   // OK - the order of evaluation is defined
    y = x || x++;   // OK - the order of evaluation is defined
    y = x++, x;     // OK - the order of evaluation is defined
    y = y++;        // OK - this rule does not report violation if a variable
                    // is modified more than once in statement.
    y = y + 1;      // OK - variable 'y' is used to determine its stored value
