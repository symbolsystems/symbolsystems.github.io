DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule reports a violation if:
- signed constant is assigned to unsigned variable/parameter
- signed constant is passed as argument to function on position where is 
  declared a parameter of unsigned type
- signed constant is returned from function that has unsigned return type
Rule triggers only when a value of constant is smaller than zero.
