DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"If an identifier is declared in an inner scope and it uses the same name
as an identifier that already exists in an outer scope, then the innermost
declaration will "hide" the outer one. This may lead to developer confusion."

The rule reports a violation if an identifier declared in an inner class scope
hides an identifier declared in an outer class scope or in public/protected 
section outer class's parents.
