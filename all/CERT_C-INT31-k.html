The second and third operands of the ternary operator shall have the same essential type category [CERT_C-INT31-k-2]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"The C language allows the programmer considerable freedom and will permit
conversions between different arithmetic types to be performed automatically.
However, the use of these implicit conversions can lead to unintended results,
with the potential for loss of value, sign or precision."

"Both operands of an operator in which the usual arithmetic conversions
are performed shall have the same essential type category. The second
and third operands of the ternary operator are covered by this rule."
[MISRA C:2012 Rule 10.4]

This rule detects cases when the second and third operands of the ternary
operator have different essential types.

The term "essential type" is defined by the MISRA C:2012 standard,
but tools may also provide additional ways of identifying "essentially
Boolean" types.

<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule assumes that "essentially Boolean" type is defined as one of
the following:
  - _Bool type defined in C99 standard library 'stdbool'
  - the result of a relational, equality and logical operator
  - an enumeration type whose name begins with 'bool' (case insensitive)
    or contains 'boolean' (case insensitive) and contains exactly 2 enumeration
    constants
  - typedef whose name begins with 'bool' (case insensitive)
    or contains 'boolean' (case insensitive) to:
    -- a char type defined explicitly as signed or unsigned
    -- a short or int type
    -- an enumeration type which contains exactly 2 enumeration constants

Enumeration constants have "essentially Boolean" type if they are defined
inside "essentially Boolean" types.

Integer constants with values '0' and '1' are considered to be constants of
"essentially Boolean" type.

typedef enum {false, true}  bool;   /* essentially Boolean type */
void foo(unsigned int ui) {
    bool b;
    signed int i;
    (ui &gt; 0) ? b : 0;   /* OK */
    (ui &gt; 0) ? i : 0;   /* OK */
}

<STRONG>
EXCEPTIONS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"The operators covered by this rule may have one operand with essentially
real floating type and the other operand with essentially complex floating type.
In the case of the conditional operator, this exception applies to the second
and third operands." [MISRA C:2012 Amendment 3]



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"The use of stronger typing, as enforced by the MISRA essential type model,
allows implicit conversions to be restricted to those that should then produce
the answer expected by the developer." [MISRA C:2012 Rule 10.4]



</PRE>
<STRONG>
DRAWBACKS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule can report a false violation if a nested conditional operator (more
than one level of nesting) is used as the operand. For example:

void foo(int a, int b) {
    !((a &gt; b) ? a &gt; b : (a &gt; b ? 0 : (a &gt; b ? 0 : 1))); /* Violation */
}

<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

signed int ret_int(void);

void foo ( float f )
{
    char ch;
    unsigned int ui;

    (ui &gt; 0) ? 'E' : 10;        /* Violation - "character" and "signed" */
    (ui &gt; 0) ? ui : ret_int();  /* Violation - "unsigned" and "signed" */
    (ui &gt; 0) ? f : ch;          /* Violation - "floating" and "character" */
}

/* Examples of correct code */
#include &lt;complex.h&gt;

signed int ret_int(void);

void foo ( float f )
{
    signed char sc;
    unsigned int ui;
    float complex cf;

    (ui &gt; 0) ? ui : 10u;        /* OK */
    (ui &gt; 0) ? sc : ret_int();  /* OK */
    (ui &gt; 0) ? f : 10.0;        /* OK */
    (ui &gt; 0) ? cf : f;          /* OK - Exception */
}
