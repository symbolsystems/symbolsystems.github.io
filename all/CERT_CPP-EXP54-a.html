DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>
This rule detects uses of resources that have been freed. In particular, a violation is reported
when a pointer or reference to a freed resource is:

   * returned from a function,
   * passed as a parameter to a function,
   * used in an arithmetic operation,
   * dereferenced, or
   * assigned to a variable/field/array element.

PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>
The "Report violation when pointer to freed resource is compared to null" check box
unsupresses/suppresses  violations where a pointer to a freed resource is compared to a null
pointer. This may be allowed by the code writing policy and application design.
By default, such violations are not reported.

The "Report violation when pointer to freed resource is compared to other pointers" check box
unsuppresses/suppresses violations where a pointer to a freed resource is compared to other
pointers. This may be allowed by the code writing policy and application design.
By default, such violations are not reported.

The "Report unvalidated violations" parameter can result in more violations,
but possibly also more false positives, being reported. In this mode Flow 
Analysis will not check whether the path of the violation can be reached from
the beginning of the function. In some complicated cases, restricted analysis
depth may prevent Flow Analysis from completing the violation validation
procedure. If this happens, violation can be found only with this parameter 
turned on.

The types of resources handled by this rule can be viewed and edited in test configuration section:

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Here is an example that will trigger a violation:

int compute(int* buffer, const int size)
{
    int result = 0;
    // perform computations
    delete[] buffer;
    return result;
}

void process(const int size)
{
    int* buffer = new int[size];
    int result = compute(buffer, size);
    delete[] buffer;
    // do something
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Removing delete in the compute() function repairs the example above.

int compute(int* buffer, const int size)
{
    int result = 0;
    // perform computations
    return result;
}

void process(const int size)
{
    int* buffer = new int[size];
    int result = compute(buffer, size);
    delete[] buffer;
    // do something
}
