DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Where a data value is to be tested against zero then the test should be made 
explicit. The exception to this rule is when data represents a Boolean value, 
even though in C this will in practice be an integer."

An 'effectively Boolean' expression which is either 'Boolean-by-construct'
or 'Boolean-by-enforcement' as defined below.

Boolean-by-construct values are produced by the following operators:
- equality operators (== and !=)
- logical operators (!, &amp;&amp; and ||)
- relational operators (&lt;, &gt;, &lt;= and &gt;=)

Boolean-by-enforcement values can be introduced by implementing a specific type
enforcement mechanism using a tool. A Boolean type could be associated with
a specific typedef, and would then be used for any objects that are Boolean."

Rule does not report violation if as an operand of logical operator is used:
- Boolean-by-construct values
- boolean constant
- integer or enum constant defined as '0' or '1' 
- variable, parameter or expression of type:
  - bool,
  - typedef to bool,
  - an enumeration type whose name begins with 'bool' (case insensitive)
    or contains 'boolean' (case insensitive) and contains exactly 2 enumeration
    constants
  - typedef whose name begins with 'bool' (case insensitive)
    or contains 'boolean' (case insensitive) to:
    -- a char type defined explicitly as signed or unsigned
    -- a short or int type
    -- an enumeration type which contains exactly 2 enumeration constants
  - reference to above types

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

1. Rule checks first operand of tenary operator "?:". MISRA C:2012 Rule 14.4
   does not require checking of tenary operator. But MISRA C:2012 Rule 10.1 
   requires first operand of tenary operator to have boolean type.
   For example:
    void foo (int i) {
        i ? 1 : 0;  // Violation reported
    }

2. Rule does not report violations if the expression is a single constant.
   For exmaple:
    if (0)      // Single constant "0" - violation not reported
    if (123)    // Single constant "123" - violation not reported
    if (120+3)  // Violation reported

3. Rule does not report violations if the expression denotes a function.
   For example:
    void foo1(void);
    void foo2(void) {
        if (foo1);   // Violation not reported
        if (*foo1);  // Violation not reported
    }

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"This rule is in the interests of clarity, and makes clear the distinction
between integers and logical values."

EXAMPLE

<PRE>

int goo()
{
    return 1;
}

void foo( int x, int y )
{
  if (goo()) {}	// Violation
  if (y) {}     // Violation
}

REPAIR

<PRE>

int goo()
{
    return 1;
}

void foo( int x, int y )
{
  if (goo() != 0) {}	// OK
  if (y != 0) {}        // OK
}
