DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"In C89 (and historical K&amp;R implementations), the meaning of the remainder
operator for negative operands was implementation-defined. This behavior was
changed in C99, and the change remains in C11. Because not all C compilers
are strictly C-conforming, programmers cannot rely on the behavior of the %
operator if they need to run on a wide range of platforms with many different
compilers." [CERT-INT10-C]

This rule detects when an operand of the remainder operator is of integer type
other than an unsigned type.

<STRONG>
EXCEPTIONS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule allows you to use an integer or enumeration constant with a positive
value as the operand of the remainder operator, even if its type is not
unsigned.

void f1(unsigned int index)
{
    unsigned int remainder;
    remainder = index % 5;      // OK - Exception
}

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Incorrectly assuming that the result of the remainder operator for signed
operands will always be positive can lead to an out-of-bounds memory accessor
other flawed logic." [CERT-INT10-C]

This rule helps you avoid undefined and implementation-defined behavior.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

void f1(int index, int size)
{
    unsigned int remainder;
    remainder = (index + 1) % size;           // Violation
    remainder %= size;                        // Violation
}

REPAIR

<PRE>

void f1(unsigned int index, unsigned int size)
{
    unsigned int remainder;
    index = (index + 1) % size;               // OK
    index %= size;                            // OK
}
