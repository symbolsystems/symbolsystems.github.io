DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"An operand of essentially enum type should not be used in an arithmetic 
operation because an enum object uses an implementation-defined integer type.
An operation involving an enum object may therefore yield a result with an 
unexpected type. Note that an enumeration constant from an anonymous enum has 
essentially signed type." [MISRA C:2012 Rule 10.1]

This rule detects cases when the operands of the following operators
have essentially enum type:
 +, -, *, /, %, &gt;&gt;, &lt;&lt;, ~, &amp;, |, ^, ++, --, +=, -=, /=, *=, ^=, |=, &amp;=, &lt;&lt;=, 
 &gt;&gt;=, %=

This rule assumes that the enumeration type defined as "essentially Boolean"
type is not essentially enum type.
 
The term "essential type" is defined by the MISRA C:2012 standard, 
but tools may also provide additional ways of identifying "essentially 
Boolean" types.

NOTES

<PRE>

The rule assumes that "essentially Boolean" type is defined as one of
the following:
  - _Bool type defined in C99 standard library 'stdbool'
  - the result of a relational, equality and logical operator
  - an enumeration type whose name begins with 'bool' (case insensitive)
    or contains 'boolean' (case insensitive) and contains exactly 2 enumeration
    constants
  - typedef whose name begins with 'bool' (case insensitive)
    or contains 'boolean' (case insensitive) to:
    -- a char type defined explicitly as signed or unsigned
    -- a short or int type
    -- an enumeration type which contains exactly 2 enumeration constants

Enumeration constants have "essentially Boolean" type if they are defined
inside "essentially Boolean" types.

This rule prevents confusion and implementation defined behaviours.

EXAMPLE

typedef enum {EN1, EN2} TE1;   /* essentially enum type */
enum { EN11, EN12 } en1;       /* essentially enum type */

void foo( int res )
{
    TE1 te1;
    EN1 * 10;           /* Violation */
    en1--;              /* Violation */
    te1 &gt;&gt;= 1u;         /* Violation */
    10 + EN11;          /* Violation */

/* Examples of correct code */
typedef enum {EN1, EN2} TE1;   /* essentially enum type */
enum { EN11, EN12 };           /* EN11, EN22 have essentially signed type */

void foo( int res )

    TE1 te1;
    if (EN1 == te1);    /* OK */
    10 + EN11;          /* OK */
