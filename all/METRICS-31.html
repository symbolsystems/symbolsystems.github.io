DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"The assertion density of the code should average to a minimum of two assertions
per function. Assertions are used to check for anomalous conditions that should
never happen in real-life executions."
The rule reports a violation if  A &lt; 2*F  where A is the number of assertions 
and F is the number of defined functions.

SINCE

v7.3

<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule detects all using of macros which names are ended by 'assert' 
e.g. 'assert', 'c_assert', 'checkAssert' etc.
The rule checks one file at time.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Statistics for industrial coding efforts indicate that unit tests often
find at least one defect per 10 to 100 lines of code written. The odds
of intercepting defects increase with assertion density. Use of assertions
is often also recommended as part of a strong defensive coding strategy.
Assertions can be used to verify pre- and post-conditions of functions,
parameter values, return values of functions, and loop-invariants. 
Because assertions are side-effect free, they can be selectively disabled
after testing in performance-critical code."

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

/* Violation - 2 functions defined and 1 assertion used */

#define c_assert(x) ((x) ? 1 : 0);
void foo(int x) {
    /* Some code */
    c_assert(x); /* Use of assertion */
}
void bar(int x, int y) {
    /* Some code */
}
int baz();

<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

/* OK - 2 functions defined and 4 assertions used (density: 2) */

#define c_assert(x) ((x) ? 1 : 0);
void foo(int x) {
    c_assert(x); /* Use of assertion */
    /* Some code */    
}
void bar(int x, int y) {
    c_assert(x); /* Use of assertion */
    c_assert(y); /* Use of assertion */
    /* Some code */
    c_assert(x+y); /* Use of assertion */
}
int baz();
