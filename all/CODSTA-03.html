DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Constants are to be defined using const or enum; never using #define. The
preprocessor performs a textual substitution for macros in the source code 
which is then compiled. This has a number of negative consequences. For 
example, if a constant has been defined using #define, the name of the 
constant is not recognized in many debuggers. If the constant is represented 
by an expression, this expression may be evaluated differently for different
instantiations, depending on the scope of the name. In addition, macros are,
at times, incorrectly written."
