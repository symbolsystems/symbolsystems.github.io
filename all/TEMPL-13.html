DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Argument-dependent lookup (ADL) adds additional associated namespaces to the
set of scopes searched when lookup is performed for the names of called
functions. A generic function found in one of these additional namespaces would
be added to the overload set and chosen by overload resolution, which is
inconsistent with developer expectation." [MISRA C++:2008 Rule 14-5-1]

This rule detects calls to generic non-member functions from associated
namespaces.

<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule assumes that a generic non-member function from an associated
namespace can be called instead of a function from a global scope if they have
the same names and the same number of arguments.

"An associated namespace is an additional namespace that is searched during
argument-dependent lookup. The set of associated namespaces is described
in ISO/IEC 14882:2003, 3.4.2(2)." [MISRA C++:2008 Appendix C: Glossary]

"A Generic function is a function template or operator template that can be
called without explicit template arguments and whose parameters are of built-in
type or which are generic parameters. [MISRA C++:2008 Appendix C: Glossary]

BENEFITS

<PRE>

This rule helps you avoid confusions (see the Description section).

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

template &lt;typename T&gt;
class B
{
public:
    B operator+ ( long rhs){}
    void f ()
    {
        *this + 10;        // calls NS::operator+
    }
};

namespace NS
{
    class A { };
    template &lt;typename T&gt; bool operator+ ( T, int ); // Violation
}

int main()
{
    B&lt;NS::A&gt; b;
    b.f();
    return 1;
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Non-member generic functions should not be declared in associated namespaces.
