DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Global function names should start with lowercase.
This rule checks only first character of the identifier and reports a violation
if the character is not a lowercase letter (a-z).

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Rule reports violations also on extern functions declared but not defined in
current translation unit. For example:
  extern void Foo(); // Violation
There might be many reasons for such declarations:
- the function is simply defined in a different translation unit
- the function definition is not yet written
- the function is provided as a prototype and the definition should be provided
  by the user of the function
- the function definition is provided by a 3rd party library, but the library
  does not provide function declaration, so the user of the library must
  declare the function in order to use it
In the last case, it might be not possible to change the function name. In that
situation the violation can be suppressed.

EXCEPTIONS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Joint Strike Fighter coding standard allows uppercase letters in acronyms.
For example:
  void RGB_value();   // OK if "RGB" is an acronym
  void UTF8();        // OK if "UTF8" is an acronym
The acronym should be separated from the rest of the identifier with
an underscore. For example:
  void RGBvalue();    // Violation even if RGB is an acronym

To support this exception set CPPTEST_JSF_ACRONYMS environment variable to the
path to a text file containing whitespace-separated list of words. Each word
is recognized as an acronym. Example content of the file:
   RGB
   UTF8

If the CPPTEST_JSF_ACRONYMS is not set or the file could not be opened, the rule
works as if there were no acronyms at all. Opening file errors are silently
ignored.
