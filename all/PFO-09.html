DESCRIPTION

<PRE>

#pragma once is a non-standard but widely supported preprocessor directive
designed to cause the current header file to be included only once in a single
compilation. Using #pragma once in source files is useless because source files
are not meant to be included by other files. However, if source file with
#pragma once directive is meant to be included by other files one should 
reconsider if this file should not be a header file.
