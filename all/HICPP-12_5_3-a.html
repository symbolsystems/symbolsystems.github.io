DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"If a compiler implementation detects that a call to a copy constructor
is redundant, then it is permitted to omit that call, even if the copy
constructor has a side effect other than to construct a copy of the object."
Rule reports a violation if global or static member variable is modified
within a copy constructor.

<STRONG>
SINCE

<PRE>

v7.2



</PRE>
<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Rule checks only one nested level of function call.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"It is therefore important to ensure that a copy constructor does not modify
the program state as the number of such modifications may be indeterminate."

EXAMPLE

<PRE>

class A
{
public:
    A ( A const &amp; rhs )
    : m_i ( rhs.m_i )
    {
         ++m_static;   // Violation
    }
private:
    int m_i;
    static int m_static;
};

REPAIR
