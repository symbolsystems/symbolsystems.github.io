Always assign a new value to an expression that points to deallocated memory [MRM-09-3]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

All pointers should be set to either 0 or to a valid address immediately
after delete statement.
The rule reports a violation if directly after delete used on an expression
there is no assignment to this expression. 
The rule does not report violation only if in assignment is used exactly
the same expression as in delete statement.
See also: MRM-10, MRM-11, MRM-31



</PRE>
<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule checks only complex expressions. Simple parameters and variables
are checked by rules MRM-10 and MRM-11.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
EXCEPTIONS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule does not report violation if an expression that contains 
non-static member variables and does not contain global variables
is used as operand of delete in destructor.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Rule prevents accessing a pointer or a reference to a deleted object.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

struct S {
    int* p;
    int* q;
};

void foo(S* s){
    s-&gt;p = new int;
    s-&gt;q = new int(5);
    //....
    delete s-&gt;p;	// Violation - set deleted pointer in next expression
    delete s-&gt;q;	// Violation - set deleted pointer in next expression
    s-&gt;p = 0;
    s-&gt;q = new int(10);
    //...
    delete s-&gt;q;	// Violation - set deleted pointer in next expression
}

REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

struct S {
    int* p;
    int* q;
};

void foo(S* s){
    s-&gt;p = new int;
    s-&gt;q = new int(5);
    //....
    delete s-&gt;p;	// OK
    s-&gt;p = 0;
    delete s-&gt;q;	// OK
    s-&gt;q = new int(10);
    //...
    delete s-&gt;q;	// OK
    s-&gt;q = 0;
}
