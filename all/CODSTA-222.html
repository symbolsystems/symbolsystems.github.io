Avoid implicit integral conversions from a wider to a narrower type [CODSTA-222-3]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule detects when a parameter, variable, or expression of underlying
integral type is implicitly converted to a narrower integral underlying type.

<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The following operations are covered by this rule:
- Assignment by means of one of the assignment operators.
- Passing an argument to a function where the argument is copied as 
  if by assignment to the corresponding parameter.
- Returning an expression from a function where the result is copied
  as if by assignment to an object with the function's return type.
- Using an expression to initialize an object or part of an object, including
  a compound literal in C99, where the expression is copied as if by 
  assignment to the destination.
- Conversion of the constant expression in the case label of a switch statement
  to the promoted type of the controlling expression.

BENEFITS

<PRE>

"An implicit conversion that results in the size of a type being reduced
may result in a loss of information." [MISRA C++:2008 Rule 5-0-6]

EXAMPLE

<PRE>

unsigned short ret_u16a(signed int i);

signed int foo1 ( unsigned int u32a, unsigned long long u64a ) {
    unsigned char u8a = 255;         /* Violation */
    unsigned short u16a = u32a + 1;  /* Violation */

    u16a = u32a;                     /* Violation */
    u8a  = ret_u16a(u16a);           /* Violation */
    ret_u16a(u64a);                  /* Violation */
    
    return u64a;                     /* Violation */

    unsigned char u8a = 255u;                           /* OK */
    unsigned short u16a = (unsigned short)(u32a + 1u);  /* OK */

    /* The 'underlying type' of the expression 'u8a + u8a' is unsigned char */
    u16a = u8a + u8a;        /* OK */
    u16a  = ret_u16a(u32a);  /* OK - this rule does not report violations on
                                     conversions between signed and unsigned
                                     types if they have the same size */
    
    return u32a_long;        /* OK - if 'int' and 'long' have the same size */
