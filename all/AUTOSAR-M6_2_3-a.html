DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Null statements should not normally be included deliberately, but where they
are used, they shall appear on a line by themselves. White-space characters
may precede the null statement to preserve indentation. If a comment follows
the null statement, then at least one white-space character shall separate
the null statement from the comment." [MISRA C++:2008]

The rule detects the following cases:
- A null statement is used on a line that contains other non-white-space
  characters (with the exception of correctly placed comments).
- A null statement is used on a line that contains an incorrectly placed
  comment.

The rule assumes that a comment is correctly placed if it follows the null
statement and there is at least one white-space character between the null
statement and the comment.

EXCEPTIONS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule allows a null statement to be used on the same line
as its 'fallthrough' attribute.

int f1(int a) {
  switch (a) {
    case -1 :
      [[fallthrough]];  // OK - Exception
    default:
      return 0;
  }
}

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"The use of a white-space character to separate the null statement from any
following comment is required on the grounds that it provides an important
visual cue to reviewers. Following this rule enables a static checking tool
to warn of null statements appearing on a line with other text, which would
normally indicate a programming error." [MISRA C++:2008]

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

#define ADD(i, j) i + j;

void f1(int p1, int p2)
{
    if(p1 &gt; 0);        /* Violation */
    p1 = ADD(p1, p2);  /* Violation */
    /* Violation */ ;
    ;/* Violation */
}

<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

You can fix the code by moving the null statement to a separate line.

#define ADD(i, j) i + j

void f1(int p1, int p2)
{
    if(p1 &gt; 0)
        ;              /* OK */
    p1 = ADD(p1, p2);  /* OK */
    ; /* OK */
    ;                  /* OK */
}
