DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

An object should be completely initialized in a constructor. It is recommended
to use a default member initializer or a constructor initialization list.

This rule detects when a non-aggregate class contains non-static data members
which are not initialized at the top of a constructor body.

A data member is initialized at the top of a constructor in one
of the following ways:
 - the data member has a default member initializer
 - the data member is initialized in the constructor initialization list
 - the data member's type contains an explicit declaration of a constructor.

<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule does not apply to delegating constructors.

An aggregate is a class or struct with
  - no user-provided, explicit, or inherited constructors, and
  - no private or protected non-static data members, and
  - no virtual functions, and
  - no virtual, private, or protected base classes



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule helps you reduce the risk of an invalid state existing after
successful construction.

class C1
{
public:
    C1();
    C1(int i);
private:
    int m1;
    int m2;
};

C1::C1() : m1(0) {}    // Violation
C1::C1(int i) {}       // Violation

class C2               // Violation
{
public:
    void f();
private:
    int m1;
    int m2;
};
