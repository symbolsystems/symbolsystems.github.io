DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"All you really need to remember is that STL containers are smart, but they're
not smart enough to know whether to delete the pointers they contain. To avoid
resource leaks when you have containers of pointers that should be deleted,
you must either replace the pointers with smart reference-counting pointer
objects (such as Boost's shared_ptr) or you must manually delete each pointer
in the container before the container is destroyed."
Rule enforces replacing the pointers with smart reference-counting pointer
objects (such as Boost's shared_ptr) as it is exception-safe solution.
