DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"When a translation unit contains a complex hierarchy of nested header files
it can happen that a particular header file is included more than once.
This can be, at best, a source of confusion. If it leads to multiple or 
conflicting definitions, the result can be undefined or erroneous behaviour."
Rule checks if any of described below mechanisms preventing the file contents 
from being included more than once is present.

#ifndef AHDR_H
#define AHDR_H
/* The following lines will be excluded by the
preprocessor if the file is included more
than once */
...
#endif

Alternatively, the following may be used:

#ifdef AHDR_H
#error Header file is already included
#else
#define AHDR_H
/* The following lines will be excluded by the
preprocessor if the file is included more
than once */
...
#endif
