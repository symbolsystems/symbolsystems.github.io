DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"For each type T from the C standard library, the types ::T and std::T
are reserved to the implementation and, when defined, ::T shall be identical
to std::T. These types are clock_t, div_t, FILE, fpos_t, lconv, ldiv_t,
mbstate_t, ptrdiff_t, sig_atomic_t, size_t, time_t, tm, va_list, wctrans_t,
wctype_t, and wint_t." [ISO/IEC 14882:2017]

This rule detects when identifiers with the following names are declared:
defined, final, override, clock_t, div_t, FILE, fpos_t, lconv, ldiv_t,
mbstate_t, ptrdiff_t, sig_atomic_t, size_t, time_t, tm, va_list, wctrans_t,
wctype_t and wint_t.
