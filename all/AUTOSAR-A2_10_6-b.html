DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"For C compatibility, it is possible in C++ for a name to refer
to both a type and object or a type and function. This can lead
to confusion." [MISRA C++:2008 Rule 2-10-6]

"A class name or enumeration name can be hidden by the name of an object, 
function, or enumerator declared in the same scope. If a class or enumeration
name and an object, function, or enumerator are declared in the same scope
(in any order) with the same name, the class or enumeration name is hidden
wherever the object, function, or enumerator name is visible." [ISO/IEC 14882]

The rule reports a violation if in class scope is declared a type
(class/struct/union or enumeration) and an object, a function
or an enumeration constant with the same name.

Identifiers are declared in a class scope if they are members
of the class or they are members of the anonymous union declared
in the class.
