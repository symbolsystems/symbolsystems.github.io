DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule detects usage of "protected" data members.
Only "class" types are checked ("struct" and "union" are not checked).
See also: OOP-18



</PRE>
<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Rule skips 'static const' variables.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Prevents the use of "protected" data members. Protected data members, while
inaccessible within their classes, can be directly accessed by other untrusted
classes using inheritance. Using protected accessor member functions to return
data instead will prevent unauthorized access.

class A {
protected:
    int iProtectedData;  // Violation
};

<PRE>

class A {
private:
    int iPrivateData;
protected:
    const int accessData();  // OK
};
