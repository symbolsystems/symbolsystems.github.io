DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule reports a violation if "/*" is embedded in "/*" comment.

A C-style comment begins with /* and continues until the first */
is encountered.

C does not support the nesting of comments even though 
some compilers support this as a language extension.

MISRA C:2012 standard says:
   If a comment starting sequence /* occurs within a /* comment,
   is it quite likely to be caused by a missing */ comment ending sequence.

See also: COMMENT-11, COMMENT-12

<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

MISRA C:2012 standard suggests using conditional compilation (e.g. #if or
   #ifdef) instead of comments to "comment out" sections of code.

C99 added "//" comments.

To check other combinations of embedded comments see COMMENT-11 and
COMMENT-12 rules.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Detects possible accidental ommision of "*/" end-comment marker.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

/* Violation - some comment, end-comment marker accidentally omitted

&lt;new page&gt;
Perform_Safety_Critical_Code();

/* another comment closes the first comment so there are no parse errors */



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

/* review the code and decide if end-comment marked should be added */

/* alternatively, if the decide the comment/code is correct, you could
   remove/mangle the embedded comment marker:

&lt;new page&gt;
Perform_Safety_Critical_Code();

end of comment */

/* the suggested way to "comment out" code is to use conditional compilation: */
#if 0
Perform_Safety_Critical_Code();
#endif
