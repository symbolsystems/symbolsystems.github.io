DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Objects with static storage duration are always initialized - either explicitly or implicitly.
Objects with automatic storage duration, if not initialized explicitly, have indeterminate value.
Reading the value of such an object results in undefined behavior.

This rule reports a violation when:
 - a non-initialized object is used, or
 - a non-initialized element of an array is used, or
 - a non-initialized field of a class/struct is used, or
 - a field of a non-initialized union object is used

See also the PARAMETERS section for other situations when the rule may report violations.

For the purpose of this rule, an object is non-initialized when:
 - it is an uninitialized object of numeric, enum or union type, or
 - it is an array where all elements are non-initialized, or
 - it is a class/struct object with all non-static members non-initialized

EXAMPLE

struct S {
    int a;
    const char* b;
    int c;
};

// variable "i" is not initialized but it is used on a binary expression
int test01(int a)
{
    int i; 
    return a + i; // VIOLATION: non-initialized "i" is used
}

// index "1" of array "tab" is not initialized but it is copied by a return statement
int test02(int a)
{
    int tab[2];
    tab[0] = 1;
    return tab[1]; // VIOLATION: non-initialized "tab[1]" is used
}

int test03()
{
    struct S s;
    return s.c; // VIOLATION: non-initialized "s.c" is used
}

void test04()
{
    struct S s1;
    struct S s2 = s1; // VIOLATION: non-initialized "s1" is used
}

<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>
This rule does not report on atomic objects. See also the rule BD-PB-NOTINITAT.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
SECURITY RELEVANCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Reading the value of a non-initialized object results in undefined behavior.
Additionally, it can allow an attacker to control the behavior of the program, or to gain access to sensitive data.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>
The "Report when non-initialized object is passed to a third-party function as const" 
parameter allows you to specify if the rule should trigger when a non-initialized object 
is passed by pointer or reference to const to a function whose source code is not available.
Since such an object cannot be modified inside the function, it is assumed that its value will be read.
This parameter is enabled by default.

The "Report when non-initialized structure is copied" parameter allows you to
specify if the rule should trigger when a non-initialized object of class/struct/union type is:
 - used as the rhs operand of the assignment operator, or
 - passed to a function by value, or
 - returned from a function by value, or
 - thrown by value.
This parameter is enabled by default.

The "Report when partially-initialized object is copied" parameter allows you to
specify if the rule should trigger when a partially-initialized object is:
 - used as the rhs operand of the assignment operator, or
 - passed to a function by value, or
 - returned from a function by value, or
 - thrown by value.
This parameter is disabled by default.

The "Report when potentially non-initialized element of an array is used" parameter allows you to
specify if the rule should trigger when a potentially non-initialized element of an array is used.
This parameter is disabled by default.

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>
This rule helps you prevent undefined behavior.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>
    int i;
    char c[100];
Here, "i" and "c" are non-initialized.
 
For the purpose of this rule, an object is partially-initialized when:
 - it is a class/struct object with some, but not all, initialized non-static members, or
 - it is an array with some initialized elements, but the analyzer cannot deduce that all elements are initialized
Example:
    struct S {
       int a, b, c;
    };
    S s;
    s.b = 1;
Here, "s" is partially-initialized, because it contains non-initialized members "s.a" and "s.c".

For the purpose of this rule, an element of an array is potentially-initialized when
the array contains at least one initialized element, but the analyzer cannot deduce if this is the same element.
Example:
    char buf[100];
    buf[index] = 0;
    int array[10];
    array[0] = 0;
Here, "buf[42]" is a potentially-initialized element of an array if the analyzer cannot prove that "index == 42".
Also, "array[index]" is a potentially-initialized element of an array if the analyzer cannot prove that "index == 0".

REPAIR

<PRE>
Always initialize a variable before its use.

struct S {
    int a;
    const char* b;
    int c;
};

int test01(int a)
{
    int i = 1;
    return a + i; // NO VIOLATION
}

int test02(int a)
{
    int tab[2];
    tab[0] = 1;
    tab[1] = 1;
    return tab[1]; // NO VIOLATION
}

int test03()
{
    struct S s = { 1, "ABC", 1 };
    return s.c; // NO VIOLATION
}

void test04()
{
    struct S s1;
    s1.a = 1;
    s1.b = "ABC";
    s1.c = 1;
    struct S s2 = s1; // NO VIOLATION
}
