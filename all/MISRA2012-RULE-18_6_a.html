DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"If the address of an automatic object is returned from a function, then 
the object containing the address may exist beyond the time when the original
object ceases to exist (and its address becomes invalid)." [MISRA C:2004]

The rule reports a violation if a function returns a reference or a pointer
to a non-static local variable or to a parameter.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Automatic variables are destroyed at the end of the function call.
Returning a reference or pointer to such a variable allows it
to be used after its destruction, leading to undefined behaviour."
[MISRA C++:2008]



</PRE>
<STRONG>
DRAWBACKS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule has only limited support for control flow checking. For example,
a violation will not be reported if an address to a local object is first
assigned to an expression and then this expression is returned from a function.

struct S
{
    int* ps;
};

int* foo1()
{
    int var;
    int* tab[3];
    tab[1] = &amp;var;        // assigned to expression "tab[1]"
    return tab[1];        // Not reported
}

int* foo2(int p)
{
    struct S s;
    s.ps = &amp;p;            // assigned to expression "s.ps"
    return s.ps;          // Not reported
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

int* foo1(){
    int i;
    return &amp;i;     // Violation - an address of local variable returned
}

int* foo2(int p) {
    return &amp;p;     // Violation - an address of parameter returned
}

int* foo3(){
    int i;
    int* p = &amp;i;
    return p;      // Violation - an address of local variable returned
}

int&amp; foo4(){
    int i;
    return i;      // Violation - reference to local variable returned
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

A function shall not return a pointer or reference to an automatic variable.

/* Examples of code where a rule does not report violation */
int* foo1(){
    static int i;
    return &amp;i;     // OK - an address of static local variable returned
}

int* foo2(){
    int* p;
    return p;      // OK - any address is not assigned to pointer
}

int gv;
int&amp; foo3(){
    int&amp; i = gv;
    return i;      // OK - reference to global variable returned
}
