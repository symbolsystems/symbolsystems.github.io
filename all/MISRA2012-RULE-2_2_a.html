DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Any statement (other than a null statement) which has no side effect and does
not result in a change of control flow will normally indicate a programming
error." [MISRA-C:2004]

"Accessing a volatile object, modifying an object, modifying a file,
or calling a function that does any of those operations are all side effects,
which are changes in the state of the execution environment."
[ISO/IEC 9899:1999]

"The expression in an expression statement is evaluated as a void expression
for its side effects.
A null statement (consisting of just a semicolon) performs no operations." 
[ISO/IEC 9899:1999]

This rule detects when an evaluation of an expression in an expression
statement does not cause a side effect.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule assumes that:
- Any function call causes a side effect, even if no variable is modified
  as a result.
- Empty function bodies and empty blocks are acceptable and are ignored by
  the rule.

The rule triggers when an expression has no side effects, even if its
operands cause side effects.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
EXCEPTIONS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"A cast to void is assumed to indicate a value that is intentionally
not being used. The cast is therefore not dead code itself. It is treated
as using its operand which is therefore also not dead code." [MISRA C:2012]



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule helps you avoid code defects that may be caused by using statements
that neither change control flow, nor have side effects.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

struct S {
    int m;
    char * p;
};

int bar();

void foo() {
    int i = 0;
    volatile int v1 = 0;
    volatile int v2 = 0;
    struct S s, *ps;
    // Examples of incorrect code
    i + 3;                              // Violation
    3;                                  // Violation
    i;                                  // Violation
    (long)v1;                           // Violation
    v1 + v2;                            // Violation
    i + bar();                          // Violation
    ps-&gt;p + s.m;                        // Violation
    ps-&gt;m &lt;&lt; s.m;                       // Violation
    *(ps-&gt;p);                           // Violation
}

REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

You can fix the code by removing the statements without side effects,
or by modifying them so that they cause side effects.

struct S {
    int m;
    char * p;
};

int bar();

volatile struct S vS;

void foo() {
    int i = 0;
    volatile int v1 = 0;
    volatile int v2 = 0;
    struct S s, *ps;
    // Examples of correct code
    i = i + 3;               // OK - assignment
    i &lt;&lt;= 3;                 // OK - assignment
    bar();                   // OK - function call
    v1;                      // OK - volatile variable
    v1;v2;                   // OK - volatile variables
    vS.p;                    // OK - volatile variable
    if(ps-&gt;m){}              // OK - causes control flow to change
    ;                        // OK - null statement
    {}                       // OK - empty block
    (void)i;                 // OK - cast to void type
}
