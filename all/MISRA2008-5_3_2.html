DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Applying the unary minus operator to an expression of type unsigned int or 
unsigned long generates a result of type unsigned int or unsigned long 
respectively and is not a meaningful operation. Applying unary minus to an 
operand of smaller unsigned integer type may generate a meaningful signed result
due to integral promotion, but this is not good practice."

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Prevents unexpected result due to integral promotion.

EXAMPLE

void foo() {
    unsigned char  ui1;
    signed short si2;
    si2 = -ui1;                 // Violation
}

void foo() {
    unsigned char  ui1;
    signed short si2;
    si2 = -(signed short) ui1;  // OK
