DESCRIPTION

<PRE>

"Make sure that all resources are owned by objects. Perform every explicit 
resource allocation (e.g., new) in its own statement that immediately gives 
the allocated resource to a manager object (e.g., shared_ptr).
Follow the advice to perform every explicit resource allocation (e.g., new)
in its own code statement that immediately gives the resource to an owning 
object (e.g., shared_ptr)."
Rule disallows allocating more than one resource in a single statement.

"Memory allocation (by calling operator new) could be done first for both 
objects, followed by attempts to call the two constructors. That very nicely
sets things up for a leak because if one of the constructor calls throws an 
exception, then the other object's memory will never be released."
