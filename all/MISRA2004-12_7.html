DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Bitwise operations (~, &lt;&lt;, &gt;&gt;, &amp;, ^ and |) are not normally meaningful on 
signed integers. Problems can arise if, for example, a right shift moves the 
sign bit into the number, or a left shift moves a numeric bit 
into the sign bit.
The term 'underlying type' is defined as describing the type that would
be obtained from evaluating an expression if it were not for the effects
of integral promotion."

EXAMPLE

<PRE>

int foo( int x, int y )
{
    x = y &gt;&gt; 2;       // Violation
    x = y &amp; 0x0F;     // Violation
    return x | 5;     // Violation
}

REPAIR

<PRE>

int foo( int x, int y )
{
    /* Caller must make sure x and y are not negative */
    x = (unsigned int)y &gt;&gt; 2u;       /* OK */
    x = (unsigned int)y &amp; 0x0Fu;     /* OK */
    return (unsigned int)x | 5u;     /* OK */
