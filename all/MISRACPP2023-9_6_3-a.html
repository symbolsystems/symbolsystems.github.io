DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Unconstrained use of goto can lead to programs that are extremely difficult
to comprehend, analyse and, for C++, can also lead to the program exhibiting
unspecified behaviour.

However, in many cases a total ban on goto requires the introduction of flags
to ensure correct control flow, and it is possible that these flags may
themselves be less transparent than the goto they replace.

Therefore, the restricted use of goto is allowed where that use will not lead
to semantics contrary to developer expectations. 'Back' jumps are prohibited
as they can be used to create iterations without using the well-defined
iteration statements supplied by the core language."

This rule reports a violation if 'goto' is used to jump to a label which is
declared before the 'goto' location.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Restricting the use of goto so that 'back' jumps are prohibited ensures
that iteration only occurs if the iteration statements provided by the
language are used, helping to minimize visual code complexity."

EXAMPLE

<PRE>

void foo(int j)
{
    L1:
    ++j;
    goto L1; // Violation - jumps backward
    ++j;
}

<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

void foo(int j)
{
    ++j;
    goto L1; // OK -  jumps forward
    ++j;
    L1:
}
