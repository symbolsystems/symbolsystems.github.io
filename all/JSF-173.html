DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"If the address of an automatic object is assigned to another automatic object
of larger scope, or to a static object then the object containing the address
may exist beyond the time when the original object ceases to exist
(and its address becomes invalid)." [MISRA C:2004]

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule prevents undefined behaviours.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
DRAWBACKS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule does not check control flow. For example, a violation will not be
reported if an address to a local object is first assigned to a local pointer
and then that pointer is assigned to another pointer of wider scope.

void foo1(int p) {
    static int* si;
    int* ptr1 = &amp;p;
    si = ptr1;         // Not reported
}

void goo(int* p);
void foo2(){
    int i;
    goo(&amp;i);
}
int* gvar;
void goo(int* p) {
    gvar = p;          // Not reported
}

<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

int* gp;
void foo1(int** pp){
    static int* sp;
    int i, j;
    int a[4];
    
    gp = &amp;i;        // Violation
    sp = &amp;j;        // Violation
    *pp = a;        // Violation
}

void foo2(){
    int* p;
    {
        int i;
        p = &amp;i;     // Violation
    }
}
