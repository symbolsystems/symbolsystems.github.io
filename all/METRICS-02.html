DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Many case statements makes code difficult to follow. More importantly,
switches with many cases often indicate places where polymorphic behavior could
better be used to provide different behavior for different types. 
Note that although the general principle is to avoid many cases in a switch, 
the actual cutoff point is arbitrary.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Rule improves readability and maintainability of code.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

void foo(int i) {
      // There are over 10 cases in the switch statement.
      switch (i) {          // Violation
      case 1:
         break;
      case 2:
         break;
      case 3:
         break;
      case 4:
         break;
      case 5:
         break;
      case 6:
         break;
      case 7:
         break;
      case 8:
         break;
      case 9:
         break;
      case 10:
         break;
      case 11:
         break;
      default:
         break;
      }
}

REPAIR

Look for cleaner ways to invoke the alternative behaviors.
