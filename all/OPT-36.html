Do not use a variable inside its own initializer [OPT-36-3]
</STRONG>

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The variable used inside its own initializer may by automatically
initialized to 0 or may not be automatically initialized.

The use of variable in its own initializer is not reliable and may cause
undefined behaviours.

It might be caused by a misspelled identifier name (typographical error).
Or maybe the user intended to assign a different variable with the same name
but different scope? This can result in a logic error and the code should be
modified.

It might be an unwanted/dead code left behind by mistake, for example after
code refactoring or cleaning. In this case the code can be removed.

A careful code review is needed to check what was the intention of programmer
and how the code should be changed.

SINCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

v9.4



</PRE>
<STRONG>
EXCEPTIONS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Variables used in sizeof are excluded. The sizeof does not use a value
of the variable, but the type, so it does not matter that variable might
be not initialized.
There is allowed taking an address of variable.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule improves readability of code and prevents undefined behaviours.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

int foot(int);
int var_;

void foo(){
    // The code should be carefully reviewed
    int z = z + 1;        // Violation - this looks like a unwanted code
    int var = foot(var);  // Violation - this looks like a typo
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

int foot(int);
int var_;

void foo(){
    int z = 1;             // OK - unnecessary 'z' was removed
    int var = foot(var_);  // OK - variable's name was changed
}

/* Exceptions */
struct S {
	S* ps;
};

void foo1(){
    int y = sizeof(y);  // OK
    S s = {&amp;s};         // OK
}
