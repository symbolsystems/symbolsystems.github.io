DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Rule checks if there are duplicated #include directives.

Rule compares directives in one file at time (for example no violation
will be reported if the same file is included in header and source file).

Rule compares text used in #include directive so a violation will be reported
only if the text is identical (for example no violation will be reported if
different path was used to include a file).

// --- header1.h ---
#include "header2.h"
// --- file.cpp ---
#include "header1.h" /* Violation: found duplicated "header1.h" includes */
#include "header2.h" /* OK: not checked against includes in other files */
#include "header1.h"
#define HEADER "header1.h"
#include HEADER /* Violation: found duplicated HEADER includes */
#include HEADER
#include &lt;header1.h&gt; /* OK: &lt;header1.h&gt; is different than "header1.h" */
#include "./header1.h" /* OK: "./header1.h" is different than "header1.h" */
#if 0
#include "header1.h" 
#include "header3.h" /* OK: "header3.h" included in different conditional scope */
#else
#include "header3.h" /* OK: "header3.h" included in different conditional scope */
#endif
