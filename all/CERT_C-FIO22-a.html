DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>
This rule helps to ensure that allocated resources are deallocated on all paths.
Violations of the rule identify execution paths in an application where resources
are leaked.

<STRONG>
SINCE
</STRONG>

<STRONG>
SECURITY RELEVANCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Failure to close resources may lead to starvation, which could have
security implications.

<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The "Assume resource references can be stored by third-party methods of the following
types" set of parameters allows you to determine how strict the rule is when a reference
to a resource may be stored by a third-party function. For example, if there is a
third-party function SpecialCollection::add() and a resource is passed as a parameter
to this function, it will be stored in a collection and may later be closed by iterating
over the collection. Since Flow Analysis does not know the exact behavior of arbitrary
third-party functions, it behaves in either of the following ways:

   * With "Any functions" parameter enabled (the default approach), Flow Analysis assumes
     that any third-party function may store a reference to a resource if the resource is
     passed into the function. This prevents the rule from reporting false positives if
     the resource is later closed using the stored reference. However, this may also
     lead to some false negatives (real leaks are not reported as violations) if the
     function does not store a reference to the resource.
    
   * With "Functions that accept parameters which could host resource reference" parameter
     enabled, Flow Analysis assumes that a function may store a reference to a resource if
     it takes an additional parameter that can be used to store a pointer or a reference to
     the given resource. This prevents the rule from reporting false positives if the resource
     is later closed using the stored reference. However, this may also lead to some false
     negatives (real leaks are not reported as violations) if the function does not store
     a reference to the resource.
   
   * With "Functions with names matching the pattern" parameter enabled, Flow Analysis
     assumes that any third-party method which matches regex may store a reference to
     a resource if the resource is passed into the method. This prevents the rule from reporting
     false positives if the resource is later closed using the stored reference. However,
     this may also lead to some false negatives (real leaks are not reported as violations)
     if the function does not store a reference to the resource.
   
   * With all the parameters disabled, Flow Analysis takes a more aggressive approach and it
     assumes that third-party methods do not affect resources in any way. This approach
     may lead to some false positives, but it will not overlook any of the real leaks
     that the default approach may miss.

The "Report unvalidated violations" parameter can result in more violations,
but possibly also more false positives, being reported. In this mode Flow 
Analysis will not check whether the path of the violation can be reached from
the beginning of the function. In some complicated cases, restricted analysis
depth may prevent Flow Analysis from completing the violation validation
procedure. If this happens, violation can be found only with this parameter 
turned on.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Having a strict policy with respect to closing resources helps to make an application more
robust by preventing resource starvation.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Here is an example that triggers violations.

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

static void fileAllocation()
{
    FILE* p = fopen("file.name", "r");
}

static void fileReallocation()
{
    FILE* p = fdopen(0, "r");
    p = freopen("file.name", "r", p);
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>
The following code will not trigger violations:

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

static void fileAllocation()
{
    FILE* p = fopen("file.name", "r");
    fclose(p);
}

static void fileReallocation()
{
    FILE* p = fdopen(0, "r");
    p = freopen("file.name", "r", p);
    fclose(p);
}
