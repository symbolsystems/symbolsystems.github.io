Prevent calling unsafe functions (custom rule) [BD-MISC-DC-5]
</STRONG>
<BR><BR>

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>
This rule allows you to specify functions that should not be used.
It must be parametrized with the names of functions that are not allowed.
The rule detects calls of the functions, as well as cases when the function addresses have
been used.

PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>
The "Disallowed functions" parameter allows you to specify functions that should not be used
and will be detected by the rule.

The following columns allow you to define different aspects of functions in the functions table: 

* The 'Enabled' column can be used to temporarily disable some of the defined functions for Flow Analysis.

* The 'Fully qualified type name or namespace (wildcard)' column should be used to provide the fully qualified name of the type or namespace
  where the function is declared. Use '*' if you want to describe a function declared in any type or namespace,
  or a global function declared outside of any type or namespace.

* The 'Function name (wildcard)' should contain the name of the described function.

* The '+ definitions in subclasses' is used to indicate whether the current entry will apply
  to functions with the given name defined in subclasses of the given class.
  Note that this applies to both instance and non-instance functions.

BENEFITS

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Violations will be reported on the examples below if the "Disallowed functions" parameter
has been set in the following way:
	
	'Enabled' = true
	'Fully qualified type name' = *
	'Method name' = foo
	'+ definitions in subclasses' = false

int foo();

typedef int (*FP2)(void);

void call()
{
    int z = foo();                  // VIOLATION
    FP2 fpf = &amp;foo;                 // VIOLATION
}
