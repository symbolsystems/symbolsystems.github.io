DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Types that are not POD types are supposed to be defined as class objects,
as a class specifier forces the type to provide private access control for all
its members by default. This is consistent with developer expectations, because
it is expected that a class has its invariant, interface and could provide
custom-defined constructors." [AUTOSAR A11-0-1]

This rule detects non-POD structs and unions types.

NOTES

<PRE>

A non-POD type is a type that meets at least one of the following conditions:
- It is a class (classes are always non-POD).
- It is a struct/union that has one of the following:
  + a user-declared constructor
  + a private or protected non-static data member
  + a base class
  + a virtual function
  + a non-static member with a non-POD type (or an array of non-POD elements)
  + a non-static member with type reference
  + a user-declared copy assignment operator
  + a user-declared destructor
