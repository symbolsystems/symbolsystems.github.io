Implicit conversions from integral to floating type which may result in a loss of information shall not be used [JSF-180_f-2]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"C and C++ perform many type conversions implicitly and silently,
so as to harmonize types within an expression before evaluating it.
Some of these conversions can result in loss of information. 
Such implicit conversions shall not be used, but explicit casts
should be used instead."

The rule reports a violation if an expression of integral type
is implicitly converted to a floating type and the loss of data
is possible. The rule checks sizes for types and reports violation
only if the size of integral type is greater or equal to size of
floating type.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The size of type depends from compiler version, so the rule can report
different violations for different compilers.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
EXCEPTIONS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule does not report violation if a conversion is used:
- on a simple integer or enumeration constant
- on a bit field

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Explicit casts should normally only be used in the case where a conversion 
which could result in a loss of information is specifically required by the 
programmer. If the static checking of implicit conversions is overridden by
the use of explicit casts in this way, then the programmer should be aware
of the issues of truncation and lost of precision associated with the operation,
and should provide appropriate checking of values in the code"

void bar(float fp);

    float f = ui;           /* Violation: unsigned int assigned to float */
    f = l;                  /* Violation: long assigned to float */
    bar(ui);                /* Violation: unsigned int assigned to float */
    return ui + ull;        /* Violation: unsigned int assigned to float */
