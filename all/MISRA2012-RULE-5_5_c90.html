Identifiers shall be distinct from macro names (c90) [MISRA2012-RULE-5_5_c90-2]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"This rule requires that the names of macros that exist prior to preprocessing
be distinct from the identifiers that exist after preprocessing. It applies to
identifiers, regardless of scope or name space, and to any macros that have 
been defined regardless of whether the definition is still in force when the 
identifier is declared. 

The definition of distinct depends on the implementation and the version
of the C language that is being used:
- In C90 the minimum requirement is that the first 31 characters
  are significant;
- In C99 the minimum requirement is that the first 63 characters
  are significant, with each universal character or extended source
  character counting as a single character." [MISRA C:2012 Rule 5.5]

This rule detect cases when the name of the macro before preprocessing and 
the name of the identifier after preprocessing are the same or the first 31
characters of their names are identical.
