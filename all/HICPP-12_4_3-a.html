DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Non-static members should not be initialized more than once in a constructor.
Initializing a data member in an initializer list and in the base class will
create confusion as to which value is being set to the data member.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
SINCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

v10.4



</PRE>
<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

If a non static member is being initialized in the base class, then it should
not be in the initialization list.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
EXCEPTIONS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"The move/copy constructors are exempt from this rule, as in this context the
rule conflicts with Rule 12.4.2: ”Ensure that a constructor initializes
explicitly all base classes and non-static data members”, which takes
precedence.” [HIC++ v4.0, Rule 12.4.3]



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Improves clarity about which value was used to initialize the data member.

EXAMPLE

<PRE>

#include &lt;cstdint&gt;

class A {
  public:
    // initialization list
    A()
        : member_1(1), member_2(1) // Violation
    {}

  private:
    int32_t member_1;
    int32_t member_2 = 0; // Violation
    int32_t member_3 = 0;
};

REPAIR

<PRE>

#include &lt;cstdint&gt;

class A {
  public:
    // initialization list
    A()
        : member_1(1) // OK. member_2 was removed from initialization list
    {}

  private:
    int32_t member_1;
    int32_t member_2 = 0; // OK
    int32_t member_3 = 0;
