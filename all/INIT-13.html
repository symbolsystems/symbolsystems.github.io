DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Members of a class are initialized in the order in which they are declared,
not the order in which they appear in the initialization list. 
The member variable used in initializer of another member variable can be not
initialized.

The rule reports a violation if member variable is used to initialize other 
member variable in constructor initialization list.

See also: INIT-10

<STRONG>
EXCEPTIONS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Variables used in sizeof are excluded. The sizeof does not use a value
of the variable, but the type, so it does not matter that variable might
be not initialized.
There is allowed taking an address of variable.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Complying with this rule leads to safer and more readable code.

EXAMPLE

class X {
public:
    X( int y );
private:
    int i;
    int j;
};

inline X::X( int y ) : j( y ), i( j ) {}    // Violation

REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

class X {
public:
    X( int y );
private:
    int i;
    int j;
};

inline X::X( int y ) : i( y ), j( y ) {}    // OK
