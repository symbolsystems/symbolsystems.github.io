DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"When a client of a class is allowed to apply an operator against a class, 
it also expects to be able to apply the negation of that operator against 
a class. A good example is the operator==; its semantic opposite is the 
operator!=, which should also be defined if operator== was defined."

The rule by default checks the following operators:
- '==' and '!='
- '&lt;=' and '&gt;='
- '&lt;' and '&gt;'
- '++' and '--' (pre- and post- operators)
- '+' and '-' (unary and binary)
- '&lt;&lt;' and '&gt;&gt;'
- '&amp;&amp;' and '||'

<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The user can himself to define pairs of operators that need to be checked.

The rule contains python method 'init' where is the list 'oppositeOperatorsList'
containing currently checked operators. 

oppositeOperatorsList = [
                          ['+', '-', '1'],
                          ['+', '-', '0'],
                          ['&gt;', '&lt;', '1'],
                          ['&gt;=', '&lt;=', '1'],
                          ['==', '!=', '1'],
                          ['&amp;&amp;', '||', '1'],
                          ['&gt;&gt;', '&lt;&lt;', '1'],
                          ['++', '--', '1'],
                          ['++', '--', '0']
                         ]

If the user does not want to check some operators, then the position containing
these operators should be removed from the list (e.g. if unary '+' and '-'
should not be checked, then the position ['+', '-', '0'], should be removed).
 
The user can himself add other operators to the list (e.g. if binary operators
'*' and '/' should be checked, then position ['*', '/', '1'], should be added
into list). The number ('1' or '0') means that defined operators have exactly
one parameter ('1' - for binary operators) or does not have any parameters
('0' - for unary operators).

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Rule improves readability and maintainability of code and 
prevents misunderstanding the meaning of an overloaded operator.
