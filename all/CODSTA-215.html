DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Updates to the C Standard have introduced new language features. . .
- Other than defining __STDC_WANT_LIB_EXT1__ to '0', the facilities of Annex K
 (Bounds-checking interfaces) shall not be used." [MISRA C:2012 Amendment 2]

"The functions, macros, and types declared or defined in K.3 and its subclauses
are declared and defined by their respective headers if __STDC_WANT_LIB_EXT1__
is defined as a macro which expands to the integer constant 1 at the point
in the source file where the appropriate header is first included."
[ISO/IEC 9899:2011]

The rule detects when the '__STDC_WANT_LIB_EXT1__' macro is defined
to a value other than '0'.

"Use of the language features restricted by this rule may have instances
of undefined, unspecified or implementation-defined behaviour associated
with them. In addition, features may also exhibit well defined behaviour
that does not meet developer expectations." [MISRA C:2012 Amendment 2]
