DESCRIPTION

<PRE>

"A loop-control-variable other than the loop-counter shall
not be modified within condition or expression.
A loop-control-variable is any variable occurring in for-init-statement,
condition or expression.
A loop-counter is a loop-control-variable that is:
  - Initialized in, or prior to, for-init-statement; and
  - an operand to a relational operator in condition; and
  - modified in expression.
loop-control-variables are either the loop-counter, or flags used for early
loop termination. The code is easier to understand if these are not modified
within condition or expression."

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule assumes that an object is modified if it is passed to the function
as a reference to a non-const object (except a universal reference) or its
address is passed to the function as a pointer to a non-const object 
(except functions which are called via function pointers).



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Rule improves readability of code.
