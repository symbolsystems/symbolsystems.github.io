Octal and hexadecimal escape sequences shall be terminated [MISRACPP2023-5_13_2-a-2]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"An octal or hexadecimal escape sequence shall be terminated by either:
  - The start of another escape sequence, or
  - The end of the character constant or the end of a string literal.
There is potential for confusion if an octal or hexadecimal escape sequence
is followed by other characters. For example, the character constant '\x1f'
consists of a single character whereas the character constant '\x1g' consists
of the two characters '\x1' and 'g'. The manner in which multi-character
constants are represented as integers is implementation-defined.
The potential for confusion is reduced if every octal or hexadecimal escape
sequence in a character constant or string literal is terminated."

/* Examples of incorrectly terminated escape sequences: */
int c1 = '\141t';            /* Violation */
const char *s1 = "\x41g";    /* Violation */
s1 = "\01 \02";              /* Violation */

REPAIR

<PRE>

/* Examples of correctly terminated escape sequences: */
int c1 = '\141\t';           /* OK */
const char *s1 = "\x41" "g"; /* OK */
s1 = "\001 \002";            /* OK */
