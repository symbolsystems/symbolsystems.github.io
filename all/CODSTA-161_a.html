DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule detects cases when the following operands are expressed as integers,
pointers or floating types different than "essentially Boolean" type:
  - the operand of the logical operator '!'
  - the right hand or the left hand operand of logical operators '&amp;&amp;' and '||'
  - the first operand of the conditional operator '?:'

The term "essential type" is defined by the MISRA C:2012 standard, 
but tools may also provide additional ways of identifying "essentially 
Boolean" type.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule assumes that "essentially Boolean" type is defined as one of
the following:
  - _Bool type defined in C99 standard library 'stdbool'
  - the result of a relational, equality and logical operator
  - an enumeration type whose name begins with 'bool' (case insensitive)
    or contains 'boolean' (case insensitive) and contains exactly 2 enumeration
    constants
  - typedef whose name begins with 'bool' (case insensitive)
    or contains 'boolean' (case insensitive) to:
    -- a char type defined explicitly as signed or unsigned
    -- a short or int type
    -- an enumeration type which contains exactly 2 enumeration constants

Enumeration constants have "essentially Boolean" type if they are defined
inside "essentially Boolean" types.

Integer constants with values '0' and '1' are considered to be constants of
"essentially Boolean" type.

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule prevents confusion and helps distinguish between integers
and logical values.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
DRAWBACKS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule can report a false violation if a nested conditional operator
(more than one level of nesting)is used as the operand. For example:

void foo(int a, int b) {
    !((a &gt; b) ? a &gt; b : (a &gt; b ? 0 : (a &gt; b ? 0 : 1))); /* Violation */
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

typedef enum {false, true} bool; /* essentially Boolean type */

void foo( void )
{
    bool b;
    int  i;
    char ch;

    if(!i);                  /* Violation */
    !( b ? 1 : 2);           /* Violation */

    if(i &amp;&amp; ch);             /* Violation */
    b = (i != b) || (i);     /* Violation */
}

REPAIR

<PRE>

#define FALSE 0
#define TRUE  1
typedef enum {false, true} bool; /* essentially Boolean type */

void foo( void )
{
    bool b;
    int  i;
    char ch;

    if(i == 0);                   /* OK */
    !( b ? TRUE : FALSE);         /* OK */

    if((i &gt; 0) &amp;&amp; (ch == 'a'));   /* OK */
    b = (i != b) || (i &gt; 0);      /* OK */
}
