Declare a copy assignment operator for classes with dynamically allocated memory [MRM-37-1]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule checks if a class, which uses 'new' to allocate its data member,
or 'delete' to deallocate its data member, has an explicitly declared
copy assignment operator. A user-declared copy assignment operator X::operator=
is a non-static, non-template member function of class X with exactly one
parameter of type X&amp;, const X&amp;, volatile X&amp; or const volatile X&amp;.

"An assignment is not inherited like other operators. If an assignment operator
is not explicitly defined, then one is automatically defined instead.
If you perform an assignment 'b = a;' (where 'a' and 'b' are pointers) there is
no client-defined operator= to call, so C++ generates and calls the default
assignment operator instead.
This default assignment operator performs memberwise assignment from the
members of 'a' to the members of 'b', which for pointers is just a bitwise copy.
There are at least two problems with this state of affairs.
First, the memory that 'b' used to point to was never deleted;
it is lost forever. This is a classic example of how a memory leak can arise.
Second, both 'a' and 'b' now contain pointers to the same character string. 
When one of them goes out of scope, its destructor will delete the memory
still pointed to by the other."

EXCEPTIONS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Rule does not report violation if there's an assignment operator in a base
class which prevents implicitly declared assignment operator in this class
from being used.

BENEFITS

<PRE>

"Bit-wise copying is only performed for member data having primitive types.
One consequence of this is that bit-wise copying is performed for member data
having pointer types. If an object manages the allocation of the instance of
an object pointed to by a pointer member, this will probably lead to problems:
either by invoking the destructor for the managed object more than once or by
attempting to use the deallocated object."

class MyClass { // Violation
public:
    MyClass( );
    ~MyClass( ) { delete p; }
private:
    int *p;
};

MyClass::MyClass( ) {
    p = new int;
}

<PRE>

class MyClass { // OK
public:
    MyClass( );
    MyClass&amp; operator=( const MyClass&amp; );
    ~MyClass( ) { delete p; }
private:

MyClass::MyClass( ) {
