DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"An include file for a class should have a file name of the form
&lt;class name&gt; + extension. Use uppercase and lowercase letters in the same way
as in the source code. Since class names must generally be unique within
a large context, it is appropriate to utilize this characteristic when naming
its include file." [Ellemtel]

The rule detects when a header file contains more than one declaration of 
non-POD structures or classes.

<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule assumes that a header file is any file included with the #include
directive.

The rule ignores nested classes and structures.

A structure is of non-POD type if it has one of the following:
  + a user-declared constructor
  + a private or protected non-static data member
  + a base class
  + a virtual function
  + a non-static member of non-POD type (or an array of non-POD elements)
  + a non-static member of reference type
  + a user-declared copy assignment operator
  + a user-declared destructor

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule makes it easier to locate a class declaration using a file-based tool.

<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

In the following example, the 'MyClass1' header file contains more than one
class declaration.

// file.cpp
#include "MyClass1.hh"

// MyClass1.hh
class MyClass1{  // Violation
    int i;
};

class MyClass2{
    int i;
};



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

To fix the code, place the declarations of the classes 'MyClass1' and
'MyClass2' in separate header files.

// file.cpp
#include "MyClass1.hh"
#include "MyClass2.hh"

// MyClass1.hh
class MyClass1{
    int i;
};

// MyClass2.hh
class MyClass2{
    int i;
};
