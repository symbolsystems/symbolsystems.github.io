DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"When the loop-counter is modified using an operator other than -- or ++,
then == and != shall not be used, as loop termination may not occur, 
which may be inconsistent with developer expectations."

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

A loop-counter is a loop-control-variable that is:
- Initialized in, or prior to, for-init-statement; and
- an operand to a relational operator in condition; and
- modified in expression.
A loop-control-variable is any variable occurring in for-init-statement,
condition or expression.

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Rule helps to ensure deterministic loop termination.

void foo()
{
