DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"A good way to ensure that the natural relationship between the assignment 
version of an operator (e.g., operator+=) and the stand-alone version 
(e.g., operator+) exists is to implement the latter in terms of the former. 
For example:"

class Rational {
public:
  Rational&amp; operator+=(const Rational&amp; rhs);
};

const Rational operator+(const Rational&amp; lhs,
                         const Rational&amp; rhs)
{
  return Rational(lhs) += rhs;
}

BENEFITS

<PRE>

"In this example, operators += is implemented (elsewhere) from scratch, and 
operator+ calls them to provide their own functionality. With this design, only 
the assignment version of these operator need to be maintained. Furthermore, 
assuming the assignment versions of the operators are in the class's public 
interface, there is never a need for the stand-alone operators to be friends 
of the class."

A operator-( A&amp; a, A&amp; b ){    // Violation

A operator*( A&amp; a, A&amp; b ){    // OK
