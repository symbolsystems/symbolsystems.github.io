Do not check for null after dereferencing [MISRA2012-DIR-4_1_f-2]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>
This rule detects cases where a reference checked for being null gets dereferenced
on any path leading to this check.

In some cases, the checks for null might have become redundant in the course of
refactoring. In other cases, it is possible that the dereference was introduced
into code that already had the null check, but the developer mistakenly added
the dereference before the null check. This usually results in a null reference
exception. In any case, such a condition usually points to an inconsistency in
the code, which should be reviewed for correctness.

How it works:
The rule inspects null checks present in the code and determines whether they
are redundant. To do this, it examines all the code paths that lead to
the null check (for example, of variable "foo"). If it finds a dereferencing
of the variable "foo" along all these paths, then it reports a violation.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>
When both the dereference and the null check are within the same function,
this almost always indicates a problem with the logic. When one of these
is in a different function, a more careful review is needed before
proceeding to fix the reported violation. Even though
an obvious solution may be to remove the null check, it is possible that
the null check is a protection against future changes.

PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The "Assume that the following functions can be passed arbitrary values" parameter can be configured to assume that the
specified functions can be passed arbitrary values.

It is controlled by "global functions", "functions with internal linkage", "member functions of the following visibility:"
checkboxes and the group of radio buttons representing member functions visibilities. 

"global functions" and "functions with internal linkage" parameters define the rule assumptions about global functions 
and functions with internal linkage (static global functions or functions from anonymous namespaces)
"member functions of the following visibility:" parameter determines the assumptions for member functions.
If the checkbox is unchecked, we will assume that there is no such member function to which an arbitrary variable can be
passed. If the checkbox is checked, it indicates that there is a subset of functions to which arbitrary values can
be passed.
In this case, the options are the following:  
   * public 
   * public, protected 
   * member functions of any visibility (least aggressive, most accurate)

Choosing the default options will result in fewer
violations being reported, and a very low number of false
positives. Choosing "public, protected" and "functions with internal linkage"
also usually produces good results. You may want to try different options and 
pick the one best suited to your code base.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Helps you detect code that is fraught with the danger of null dereferencing and find
fragments of dead code.

<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Here is an example which triggers a violation due to a problem with logic:

#include "stdio.h"

static void checkSequence(char cur[])
{
    if (cur[0] == '-') {
        printf("Error: only positive values are permitted");
        return;
    }
    // misplaced null check
    if (cur == 0) {
        printf("Error: null argument provided");
        return;
    }
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>
The misplaced null check should precede the array processing code:

#include "stdio.h"

static void checkSequence(char cur[])
{
    if (cur == 0) {
        printf("Error: null argument provided");
        return;
    }
    if (cur[0] == '-') {
        printf("Error: only positive values are permitted");
        return;
    }
}
