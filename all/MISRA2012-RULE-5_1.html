DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"This rule requires that different external identifiers be distinct within the
limits imposed by the implementation.

The definition of distinct depends on the implementation and on the version of
the C language that is being used:
- In C90 the minimum requirement is that the first 6 characters of external
  identifiers are significant but their case is not required to be significant;
- In C99 the minimum requirement is that the first 31 characters of external
  identifiers are significant, with each universal character or corresponding
  extended source character occupying between 6 and 10 characters.

In practice, many implementations provide greater limits. For example it is
common for external identifiers in C90 to be case-sensitive and for at least
the first 31 characters to be significant." [MISRA C:2012 Rule 5.1]

This rule detect cases when different external identifiers have the same first
31 characters of their names.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Long identifiers may impair the readability of code. While many automatic code
generation systems produce long identifiers, there is a good argument for
keeping identifier lengths well below this limit." [MISRA C:2012 Rule 5.1]

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Keeping external identifiers distinct can help you avoid undefined behaviors.
