DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"A member function that does not affect the state of an object (its instance
variables) will be declared const. Member functions should be const by default.
Only when there is a clear, explicit reason should the const modifier on member
functions be omitted. Declaring a member function const is a means of ensuring
that objects will not be modified when they should not."

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Const-correctness is worthwhile, proven, effective, and highly recommended.
Understanding how and where a program's state changes is vital, and const
documents that directly in code where the compiler can help to enforce it.
Writing const appropriately helps you gain a better understanding of your
design and makes your code sturdier and safer.
If you find it impossible to make a member function const, you usually gain
a better understanding of the ways in which that member function might modify
an object's state."
