DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Updates to the C Standard have introduced new language features. The following
shall not be used:
- The _Thread_local storage class specifier and the facilities that are
  specified as being provided by &lt;threads.h&gt;;" [MISRA C:2012 Amendment 2]

The rule detects when the '_Thread_local' storage class specifier is used
in a variable declaration.

<STRONG>
SINCE

<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule triggers if a macro that expands to the '_Thread_local' class
specifier (such as the 'thread_local' macro from the 'threads.h' library) is
used in a variable declaration.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Use of the language features restricted by this rule may have instances
of undefined, unspecified or implementation-defined behaviour associated
with them. In addition, features may also exhibit well defined behaviour
that does not meet developer expectations." [MISRA C:2012 Amendment 2]

_Thread_local int i1;              /* Violation */
