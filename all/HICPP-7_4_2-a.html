DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"An inline function . . . that is intended for use in multiple translation
units should be defined in a single header file, so that the definition will
be processed in exactly the same way (the same sequence of tokens) in each
translation unit." ["High Integrity C++ Coding Standards"]

This rule detects when an inline function with external linkage has more
than one definition in the testing scope.
The rule does not report violations on inline functions that are defined
in unnamed namespaces.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule analyzes definitions in files in the testing scope. For this reason,
the set of findings reported for the same file may vary depending
on the scope of analysis.

The rule operates on all files in the testing scope. For this reason, it is
important to specify a testing scope that reflects the system architecture
(for example, it may be appropriate to define a testing scope that corresponds
to a single, complete, linkable module).



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule helps you avoid undefined behavior, as well as improve
the maintainability of your code.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Assumption:
the testing scope contains only 'test1.cpp', and 'test2.cpp'.

// test1.cpp
inline void foo() {                    // Violation
    //...
}

void bar1() {
    foo();
}

// test2.cpp
inline void foo() {                    // Violation
    //...
}

void bar2() {
    foo();
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR

<PRE>

Assumption:
the testing scope contains only 'test.h', 'test1.cpp', and 'test2.cpp'.

// test.h
inline void foo() {                    // OK
    //...
}

// test1.cpp
#include "test.h"
void bar1() {
    foo();
}

// test2.cpp
#include "test.h"
void bar2() {
    foo();
}
