DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>
This rule detects situations when an exception is thrown but not caught. By default, it checks if
the developer failed to catch the exception in the 'main' method or destructor.

PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>
The "Functions which cannot throw exceptions" parameter allows you to specify additional functions 
that are not allowed to throw exceptions. 

The following columns allow you to define different aspects of functions in the functions table: 

* The 'Enabled' column can be used to temporarily disable some of the defined functions for Flow Analysis.

* The 'Fully qualified type name or namespace (wildcard)' column should be used to provide the 
  fully qualified name of the type or namespace where the function is declared. Use '*' if you want to 
  describe a function declared in any type or namespace, or a global function declared outside of any 
  type or namespace.

* The 'Function name (wildcard)' should contain the name of the described function.

* The '+ definitions in subclasses' is used to indicate whether the current entry will apply
  to functions with the given name defined in subclasses of the given class.
  Note that this applies to both instance and non-instance functions.

The "Aggressive mode" encourages Flow Analysis to report a violation any time that Flow Analysis
suspects a problem - even if there is high probability that such a case may be a false positive.
Applying this configuration will result in more bugs being reported, but it can also increase the
number of false alarms. In "Aggressive mode", the rule will report a violation any time it finds
a path with an uncaught exception, even if the path does not begin with a main method or with 
a method defined in the "Methods which cannot throw exceptions" parameter or does not contain 
a destructor.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Throwing an exception which is not caught can indicate a possible bug in the code.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Here is an example that triggers a violation:

void foo(int n) {
    if (n &gt; 2) {
        throw 3;
    } else {
        throw 3.0; // VIOLATION
    }
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    try {
        foo(argc);
    } catch (int&amp; a) {
    }
}

In the example above, if the argc is at most 2, the exception of type double will not be caught.

    if (n &gt; 2) {
        throw 3;

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
