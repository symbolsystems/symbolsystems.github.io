Always provide empty brackets ([]) for delete when deallocating arrays [AUTOSAR-A18_5_3-b-2]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Use the same form in corresponding calls to new and delete.
This rule checks calls to new and delete to make sure that
they use the same form; it reports a violation if you call
new[] but forget to use [] when calling delete. If you do
not use the same form in corresponding calls to new and delete, 
an incorrect number of destructors may be called.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Prevents using different kinds of 'new' and 'delete' calls.

public:
    A( ) {}
};

void foo( ) {
    A *a = new A[100];
    delete a;              // Violation
}
