The value returned by a POSIX library function that may return an error should be used [CERT_C-POS54-a-1]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"All standard library functions, including I/O functions and memory allocation
functions, return either a valid value or a value of the correct return type
that indicates an error (for example, âˆ’1 or a null pointer). Assuming that all
calls to such functions will succeed and failing to check the return value for
an indication of an error is a dangerous practice that may lead to unexpected
or undefined behavior when an error occurs. It is essential that programs
detect and appropriately handle all errors in accordance with an
error-handling policy." [CERT-POS54-C]

This rule detects when values returned from POSIX library functions are not
used. All functions whose names are the same as the names of functions declared
in the POSIX library are detected as POSIX library functions.

</PRE>
<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule assumes that the function return value is used when it is assigned to
a variable, returned from a function, checked in a selection or iteration
statement, used to call a function, etc.

The list of function names can be modified by the user in the python method
'initPosixFuncSet' implemented on top of the rule. The list of functions can be
extended by adding a name to the 'funcSet' or limited by removing the name from
the 'funcSet' or adding it to the 'excludedSet'.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
EXCEPTIONS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Return values from some functions are ignored because their historical use has
overwhelmingly omitted error checking, and the consequences are not relevant to
security.

The excluded functions are: printf(), putchar(), puts(), putwchar(), vprintf(),
vwprintf(), and wprintf().



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule helps you prevent unexpected or undefined behavior when an error
occurs during the call to the POSIX library function.

/* Examples of unused function return value: */
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
void bar (void *p)
{
    posix_memalign(&amp;p, 128, 128);                  /* Violation */
}

/* Examples of used function value: */

{
    if(0 != posix_memalign(&amp;p, 128, 128))          /* OK */
    {
        return 1;
    }
    return 0;
