DESCRIPTION

<PRE>

"Downcasts can be eliminated in a number of ways. The best way is to replace
such casts with calls to virtual functions, possibly also making each virtual
function a no-op for any classes to which it doesn't truly apply. A second
method is to tighten up the typing so that there is no ambiguity between
the declared type of a pointer and the pointer type that you know is really
there. Whatever the effort required to get rid of downcasts, it's effort well
spent, because downcasts are ugly and error-prone, and they lead to code that's
difficult to understand, enhance, and maintain"

EXCEPTIONS

The rule allows to use downcasting via 'dynamic_cast' operator.
"When you use dynamic_cast on a pointer, the cast is attempted,
and if it succeeds (i.e., if the dynamic type of the pointer
is consistent with the type to which it's being cast), 
a valid pointer of the new type is returned.
If the dynamic_cast fails, the null pointer is returned."

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Prevents illegal casts and ensures that abstraction layer is not bypassed.

class B

class D : public B

void use(B const &amp; b){
    D const *d = (D*) &amp;b;  // Violation	
    d-&gt;foo();
}

int main( )
{
    D d;
    use(d);
