DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>
This rule detects when a pointer value is used to construct two or more 
unrelated smart pointers.

"Two smart pointers are related when the initial smart pointer is used in the 
initialization of the subsequent smart pointer objects. For instance, copying 
a std::shared_ptr object to another std::shared_ptr object via copy assignment 
creates a relationship between the two smart pointers, whereas creating a std::shared_ptr 
object from the managed pointer value of another std::shared_ptr object does not.

Do not create an unrelated smart pointer object with a pointer value that is 
owned by another smart pointer object. This includes resetting a smart pointer's
managed pointer to an already-owned pointer value, such as by calling reset()."
[SEI CERT C++ MEM56-CPP. Do not store an already-owned pointer value in an unrelated smart pointer]

Supported types of smart pointers:
	* std::shared_ptr
	* std::unique_ptr

NOTES

Smart pointer functions that are not supported:
	* reset()
	* release()

SECURITY RELEVANCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>
"Passing a pointer value to a deallocation function that was not previously obtained by the matching 
allocation function results in undefined behavior, which can lead to exploitable vulnerabilities."

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Here is an example that triggers a violation:

#include &lt;memory&gt;

void f() {
    int *i = new int;
    std::shared_ptr&lt;int&gt; p1(i);
    std::shared_ptr&lt;int&gt; p2(i);	// VIOLATION
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Use a copy constructor. Now both smart pointers are related.

#include &lt;memory&gt;

void f() {
    std::shared_ptr&lt;int&gt; p1 = std::make_shared&lt;int&gt;();
    std::shared_ptr&lt;int&gt; p2(p1);	// NO VIOLATION
}
