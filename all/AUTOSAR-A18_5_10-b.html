An overhead should be used when an array of objects is passed to the placement 'new' allocation function [AUTOSAR-A18_5_10-b-2]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Do not pass a pointer that has insufficient storage capacity for the
object being constructed, including the overhead required for arrays.
Doing so may result in initialization of memory outside of the bounds
of the object being constructed, which results in undefined behavior."

"The overhead (commonly referred to as a cookie) is necessary to store
the number of elements in the array so that the array delete expression
or the exception unwinding mechanism can invoke the type's destructor
on each successfully constructed element of the array." [CERT-CPP-MEM54]

This rule detects when an array passed as the placement argument to
an allocation function (placement 'new') allocates sufficient and suitably
aligned storage, but does not contain an overhead.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule helps you prevent undefined behavior, including a buffer overflow
and an abnormal termination.

#include &lt;new&gt;

struct S {
    S ();
    ~S ();
};

void f(int n) {
    const unsigned N = 32;
    alignas(S) unsigned char buffer[sizeof(S) * N];
    S *sp = ::new (buffer) S[N];                       // Violation
    // ...
}

const size_t overhead = sizeof(size_t);

void f(int n) {
    const unsigned N = 32;
    alignas(S) unsigned char buffer[sizeof(S) * N + overhead];
    S *sp = ::new (buffer) S[N];                                // OK
