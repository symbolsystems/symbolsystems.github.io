The One Definition Rule shall not be violated [MISRACPP2023-6_2_1-a-2]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Every program shall contain exactly one definition of every non-inline
function or object that is used in that program; no diagnostic required.
The definition can appear explicitly in the program, it can be found
in the standard or a user-defined library, or (when appropriate) it is
implicitly defined" [ISO/IEC 14882:1998].

This rule detects when objects or non-inline functions with external linkage
that are used in a program have more than one definition, or do not have any
definition in the testing scope.
The rule does not report violations on objects or functions that are declared
in unnamed namespaces.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule analyzes declarations and definitions in files in the testing scope.
For this reason, the set of findings reported for the same file may vary
depending on the scope of analysis.

The rule operates on all files in the testing scope. For this reason, it is
important to specify a testing scope that reflects the system architecture
(for example, it may be appropriate to define a testing scope that corresponds
to a single, complete, linkable module).

Assumption: the testing scope contains only 'test.h', 'test1.cpp' and 'test2.cpp'.

                               in the testing scope */
extern void foo1();
extern void foo2();         /* Violation - there is no definition of 'foo2()'
                               in the testing scope */

/* test1.cpp */
#include "test.h"
int x1 = 0;                 /* Violation - the 'x1' object has another external
                               definition in 'test2.cpp' */
void foo1() { /*...*/ }     /* Violation - 'foo1()' has another external
                               definition in 'test2.cpp' */
