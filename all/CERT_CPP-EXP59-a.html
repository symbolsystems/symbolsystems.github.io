DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"The macro offsetof(type, member-designator) accepts a restricted set of type
arguments in this International Standard.
If type is not a standard-layout class, the results are undefined.
The expression offsetof(type, member-designator) is never type-dependent
and it is value-dependent if and only if type is dependent.
The result of applying the offsetof macro to a field that is a static data
member or a function member is undefined." [ISO/IEC 14882-2014]

This rule detects when:
- a non-standard-layout class type is passed to the offsetof() macro
- a bit-field data member, static data member, or function member
  is passed to the offsetof() macro as a member-designator

v10.4

<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule assumes that a standard-layout class is a class that:
- has no non-static data members of non-standard-layout class type
- has no virtual functions
- has no virtual base classes
- has the same access control for all non-static data members
- has no non-standard-layout base classes
- has non-static data members only declared in one class within the class
  hierarchy
- has no base classes of the same type as the first non-static data member



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule helps you prevent undefined behavior.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
DRAWBACKS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule may report false positives on the type passed to the offsetof()
macro if the translation unit contains more than one class with the same
name in different namespaces.

EXAMPLE

#include &lt;cstddef&gt;

// non-standard-layout class
struct C {
    virtual void foo() {}
    int i;
};

struct D {
    static int j;
};

void foo() {
    size_t off1 = offsetof(C, i);                         // Violation
    size_t off2 = offsetof(D, j);                         // Violation
}
