Integer overflow or underflow in constant expression in '+', '-', '*' operator [MISRA2008-5_19_1_a-4]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

An integer overflow or wraparound occurs when an integer value is incremented to
a value that is too large to store in the associated representation. When this
occurs, the value may wrap to become a very small or negative number.
For example: INT_MAX + 1

A similar situation happens when an integer value is decremented to a value that
is too small to store in the associated representation. When this occurs, the
value may wrap to become a very large or a positive number.
For example: INT_MIN - 1

While this may be intended behavior in circumstances that rely on wrapping, it
can have serious consequences if the wrap is unexpected.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule checks following operators:
    +   (addition)
    -   (subtraction)
    *   (multiplication)

This rule checks only cases when both operands of the mentioned operators
are any of following:
    * integer literal
    * enum constant
    * const integer variable or const enum variable initialized with
      integer literal or enum constant

SECURITY RELEVANCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Unexpected integer overflow can sometimes trigger buffer overflows that can
be used to execute arbitrary code, as well as lead to memory corruption. This
is usually outside the scope of a program's implicit security policy.

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Unexpected integer overflow generally leads to undefined behavior that may
result in crashes. In the case of overflows involving loop index variables,
the likelihood of infinite loops is also high.

Unexpected integer overflow can be very dangerous, as the computed (incorrect)
value can be used in multiple sensitive areas, such as:
- Integer operands of any pointer arithmetic, including array indexing
- The assignment expression for the declaration of a variable length array
- The postfix expression preceding square brackets [] or the expression in
  square brackets [] of a subscripted designation of an element of an array
  object
- Function arguments of type size_t or rsize_t (for example, an argument to a
  memory allocation function)
- In security-critical code

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

void foo()
{
    // This example assumes that int has 32 bits

    // The type of the operation is signed int; range [-2147483648, 2147483647]
    // The operation will wrap to -2147483648 instead of 2147483648
    2147483647 + 1;         // Violation

    // The type of the operation is unsigned int; range [0, 4294967295]
    // Operation will wrap to 4294967295 instead of -1
    0U - 1U;                // Violation
}

<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

void foo()
{
    // This example assumes that int has 32 bits

    // Example without overflow:
    0U + 1U;                // OK

    // Using suffixes can change the type of the operands and thus change the
    // type of the operation. In this case the type of the operation is
    // unsigned int; range [0, 4294967295]
    2147483647U + 1U;       // OK
}
