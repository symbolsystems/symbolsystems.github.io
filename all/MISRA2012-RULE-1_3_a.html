Avoid division by zero [MISRA2012-RULE-1_3_a-2]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>
This rule detects execution paths where zero may potentially be used as a denominator
in a division operation. Division by zero may lead to divide-by-zero errors and should
be avoided.

<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>
The "Sensitive mode" parameter allows you to enable reporting violations
when divisors are possibly equal to zero.
With this option enabled, Flow Analysis detects not only when the actual division
by zero occurs, but also when it may (but may not) occur. This results in more
violations being reported.

This option is disabled by default.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Division by zero behavior is specified as undefinded in the language standard. For this
reason, it may result in divide-by-zero errors and abnormal program termination.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>
This rule can detect a variety of situations where division
by zero may occur. Below are a few examples that will trigger a
violation.

static int zeroMethod()
{
    return 0;
}

static void assignmentRemainderOfMethodResult()
{
    int a = 5;
    a %= zeroMethod(); // VIOLATION
}

static void assignRemainderOfVar()
{
    int a = 5;
    int b = 0;
    a %= b; // VIOLATION
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Whenever there is a chance that zero may occur in a denominator,
it is necessary to use additional methods to ensure that the denominator
is not zero.

static int zeroMethod()
{
    return 0;
}

static void assignmentRemainderOfMethodResult()
{
    int a = 5;
    int b = zeroMethod();
    if (b != 0) {
        a %= b; // NO VIOLATION
    }
}

static void assignRemainderOfVar()
{
    int a = 5;
    int b = 0;
    if (b != 0) {
        a %= b; // NO VIOLATION
    }
}
