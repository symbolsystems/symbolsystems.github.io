DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"There are some situations in C or C++ where certain parts of expressions may
not be evaluated. If these sub-expressions contain side effects then those side
effects may or may not occur, depending on the values of other sub expressions.
The operators which can lead to this problem are &amp;&amp; and || where the evaluation
of the right-hand operand is conditional on the value of the left-hand operand."
[MISRA C:2012 Rule 13.5]

"The operations that cause side effects are accessing a volatile object,
modifying an object, modifying a file, or calling a function that does
any of those operations, which cause changes in the state of the execution
environment of the calling function." [ISO/IEC 9899:1999]

"If evaluation of the right-hand operand would produce side effects which are
not persistent at the point in the program where the expression occurs then it
does not matter whether the right-hand operand is evaluated or not."
[MISRA C:2012 Rule 13.5]

"A side effect is said to be persistent at a particular point in execution
if it might have an effect on the execution state at that point. All of the
following side effects are persistent at a given point in the program:
- Modifying a file;
- Modifying an object;
- Accessing a volatile object.
When a function is called, it may have side effects. Modifying a file
or accessing a volatile object are persistent as viewed by the calling
function. However any objects modified by the called function, whose 
lifetimes have ended by the time it returns, do not affect the caller's
execution state. Any side effects arising from modifying such objects
are not persistent as viewed by the caller." [MISRA C:2012 Appendix J]

The rule reports a violation if the right-hand operand of logical operator
contains:
- assignment operator
- increment or decrement operator
- accessing a volatile object
- new, delete or throw statement
- calling a function that cause a persistent side effect (three nested levels
  of function calls are checked). Functions called via function pointer are
  not checked.

As persistent side effect in a function call is detected:
- the modification of global, member or static object
- the modification of dereferenced pointer
- the modification of argument passed by reference
- the use of volatile object
- new, delete or throw statement

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"In the case of the ?: operator, either the second or third operands are
evaluated but not both. The ?: operator is specifically provided to choose
between two sub-expressions, and is therefore less likely to lead to mistakes."
The ?: operator is checked by rule CODSTA-105.

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule prevents conditional evaluation of the right-hand operand that can
easily cause problems if the developer relies on a side effect occurring.

    if ((j == i) &amp;&amp; side_effect_function2(&amp;i)) ; // Violation
    
    // Modification of dereferenced pointer is always recognized as a persistent
    // side effect, even if, for example, the pointer points to a local variable
    if ((j == i) &amp;&amp; side_effect_function3(i)) ;  // Violation
    
    if ((j == i) &amp;&amp; side_effect_function4(i)) ;  // Violation
