DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"If a program throws an unhandled exception, it terminates in an
implementation-defined manner. In particular, it is implementation-defined
whether the call stack is unwound before termination, so the destructors of
any automatic objects may or may not be invoked. If an exception is thrown
as an object of a derived class, a "compatible type" may be either the
derived class or any of its bases."
Rule reports a violation if an unhandled exception is thrown from body
of function 'main' or from body of function that does not have any exception
on an exception specification list.

NOTES

Rule checks only one level of nested function calls.

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"The objective of this rule is that a program should catch
all exceptions that it is expected to throw."
