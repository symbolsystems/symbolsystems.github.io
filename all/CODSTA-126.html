A cast shall not be performed between a pointer to object type and a pointer to a different object type [CODSTA-126-3]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Conversion of a pointer to object into a pointer to a different object may
result in a pointer that is not correctly aligned, resulting in undefined
behaviour.
Even if conversion is known to produce a pointer that is correctly aligned,
the behaviour may be undefined if that pointer is used to access an object.
For example, if an object whose type is int is accessed as a short the behaviour
is undefined even if int and short have the same representation and alignment
requirements." [MISRA C:2012 Rule 11.3 with Amendment 4]

This rule reports a violation when a pointer to an object type is cast as a 
pointer to a different object type. This rule applies to the unqualified
types that are pointed to by the pointers.

EXCEPTIONS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"It is permitted to convert a pointer to a non-atomic qualified object type
into a pointer to one of the object types char, signed char or unsigned char. 
The Standard guarantees that pointers to these types can be used
to access the individual bytes of an object."
[MISRA C:2012 Rule 11.3 with Amendment 4]

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule prevents undefined behaviours.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
DRAWBACKS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule does not report a violation if a cast is used between pointers
to typedefs to different unnamed types.

typedef struct {int i; int j;} *TS1;
typedef struct {int i; float j;} *TS2;

void func()
{
    TS1 ps1;
    (TS2)ps1;     /* should be Violation */
}

EXAMPLE

void func()
{
    unsigned char* uc;
    unsigned int*  ui;
    const int* const* cpci;
    
    (unsigned int*)uc;       /* Violation */
    (signed int*)ui;         /* Violation */
    (int* const*)cpci;       /* Violation */
}

REPAIR

void func()
{
    unsigned char* uc;
    signed int* si;
    const int* const* cpci;
    
    (char*)uc;               /* OK - Exception */
    (int*)si;                /* OK - the same types */
    (const int**)cpci;       /* OK - the rule is applied to unqualified types */
    (int)si;                 /* OK - the cast is not to the pointer type */
