DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"An operand of essentially unsigned type should not be used as the operand to 
the unary minus operator, as the signedness of the result is determined by the 
implemented size of int" [MISRA C:2012 Rule 10.1]

This rule detects cases when the operand of a unary minus operator
has "essentialy unsigned type".

The term "essential type" is defined by the MISRA C:2012 standard.

The rule prevents unexpected results which may follow integer promotion.

    -(uc1 + uc2);    /* Violation */
    -10u;            /* Violation */
    -ret_uint();     /* Violation */
