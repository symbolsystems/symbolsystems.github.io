DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"If the keyword static also appears within the [ and ] of the array type
derivation, then for each call to the function, the value of the corresponding
actual argument shall provide access to the first element of an array with at
least as many elements as specified by the size expression."[ISO/IEC 9899:1999]

"Some compilers are able to take advantage of this information to
generate more efficient code for some types of processor. If the guarantee
made by the programmer is not honoured, and the number of elements is less
than the minimum specified, the behaviour is undefined."[MISRA C:2012]

BENEFITS

EXAMPLE

typedef void foot(int a[static 10]);        /* Violation */

void foo1(void (*fp1)(int a[static 10])) {  /* Violation */
  void (*fp2)(int a[static 10]);            /* Violation */
  fp1 = (void (*)(int a[static 10]))fp2;    /* Violation */
}
