DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>
In a union, at most one of the data members can be active at any time.
A non-active union member has indeterminate value.
Reading the value of such a member results in undefined behavior.

This rule reports a violation when a non-active union member is accessed.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>
The non-active member "b" of union "u" is returned by function "foo".

union u
{
  int a;
  int b[2];
};

int foo()
{
  u o;
  o.a = 42;
  return o.b[0]; // VIOLATION
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Always use the union member which is currently active.

union u
{
  int a;
  int b[2];
};

int foo()
{
  u o;
  o.a = 42;
  return o.a; // NO VIOLATION
}
