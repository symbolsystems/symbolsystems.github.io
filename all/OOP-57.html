DESCRIPTION

<PRE>

"A type defined as struct shall: (1) provide only public data members,
(2) not provide any special member functions or methods, (3) not be a
base of another struct or class, (4) not inherit from another struct or
class." [AUTOSAR A12-4-2]

This rule checks structs for functions, non-public members, and inherits
from another class or struct. It also checks for uses of a struct as a
base for another class or struct.

Rule improves code readability, helps differentiate a struct from a class,
and helps you achieve compliance with some coding standards.

#include &lt;cstdint&gt;

struct D              // Violation - struct has private/protected members
{
public:
  std::int32_t x;

protected:
  std::int32_t y;

private:
  std::int32_t z;
};

struct F : public D   // Violation - struct inherits from another struct
{
