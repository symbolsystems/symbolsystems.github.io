DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"To make sure that the resource returned by function is always released, we
need to put that resource inside an object whose destructor will automatically
release the resource when control leaves scope. In fact, that's half the idea
behind this Item: by putting resources inside objects, we can rely on C++'s
automatic destructor invocation to make sure that the resources are released.
In fact, the idea of using objects to manage resources is often called 
Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII), because it's so common to 
acquire a resource and initialize a resource-managing object in the same
statement. Sometimes acquired resources are assigned to resource-managing
objects instead of initializing them, but either way, every resource is
immediately turned over to a resource-managing object at the time the resource
is acquired. i.e: auto_ptr, shared_ptr."
