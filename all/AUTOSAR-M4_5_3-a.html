DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Expressions with type (plain) char and wchar_t shall not be used as operands
to built-in operators other than the assignment operator =, the equality
operators == and !=, and the unary &amp; operator."

SINCE

v7.2

<STRONG>
EXCEPTIONS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Exceptionally, the following operators may be used if the associated
restriction is observed:
- The binary '+' operator may be used to add an integral
  value in the range 0 to 9 to '0';
- The binary '-' operator may be used to subtract character '0';
- The relational operators &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, &gt;= may be used to determine
  if a character (or wide character) represents a digit.
  (Rule does not report a violation if a character constant is compared
   with a variable of type plain char)



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Manipulation of character data may generate results that are contrary
to developer expectations."

void foo()

    char ch = 't';                        // OK
