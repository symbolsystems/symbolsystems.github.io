Cast characters to unsigned char before assignment to larger integer sizes [CODSTA-187_a-3]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

For implementations in which the char type is defined to have the same
range, representation and behavior as signed char, the character value
is sign-extended when assigned to the singed integer variable. For character
code 255 decimal, this sign extension results in the value -1 being assigned
to the integer that is indistinguishable from EOF.

It is a compliant solution to cast signed character data to unsigned char
before it is assigned or converted to a larger signed integer type.

This rule detects when an expression of a plain char type that is defined
to have the same range, representation and behavior as signed char is
assigned to a larger integer size.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"This rule is applicable only in cases where the character data may contain
values that can be interpreted as negative numbers. For example, if the char
type is represented by a two's complement 8-bit value, any character value
greater than +127 is interpreted as a negative value." [CERT-STR34-C]

This rule assumes that a plain 'char' type is used only for character values.

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule prevents conversions that may cause wrong computation results.

EXAMPLE

void get_int(int p);

int foo(char ch, char* pch)
{
    int a = ch;                    /* Violation */
    int c;
    if(pch &amp;&amp; *pch) {
        c = (int)*pch;             /* Violation */
        get_int(*pch);             /* Violation */
    }
    return ch;                     /* Violation */
