Avoid initialization order problems across translation units by replacing non-local static objects with local static objects [INIT-12-3]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"If initialization of a non-local static object in one translation unit uses
a non-local static object in a different translation unit, the object it uses
could be uninitialized, because the relative order of initialization
of non-local static objects defined in different translation units is undefined.
Fortunately, a small design change eliminates the problem entirely. All that has
to be done is to move each non-local static object into its own function, where
it's declared static. These functions return references to the objects they
contain. Clients then call the functions instead of referring to the objects.
In other words, non-local static objects are replaced with local static objects."

"A static object is one that exists from the time it's constructed until the end
of the program. Stack and heap-based objects are thus excluded. Included are
global objects, objects defined at namespace scope, objects declared static
inside classes, objects declared static inside functions, and objects declared
static at file scope. Static objects inside functions are known as local static
objects (because they're local to a function), and the other kinds of static
objects are known as non-local static objects."

The rule reports a violation if a non-local static object in one translation
unit is initialized with another non-local static object that is defined
in a different translation unit.
The rule checks if an object is used:
- directly in initializer of variable
- in constructor of variable class/struct type
- in a function called in initializer (two levels of function calls are checked)

EXCEPTIONS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Variables used in sizeof are excluded. The sizeof does not use a value
of the variable, but the type, so it does not matter that variable might
be not initialized.
There is allowed taking an address of variable.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"This approach is founded on C++'s guarantee that local static objects
are initialized when the object's definition is first encountered during
a call to that function. So if you replace direct accesses to non-local
static objects with calls to functions that return references to local static
objects, you're guaranteed that the references you get back will refer
to initialized objects. As a bonus, if you never call a function emulating
a non-local static object, you never incur the cost of constructing
and destructing the object, something that can't be said for true non-local
static objects."

EXAMPLE

class FileSystem{
public:
    int foo1();
};

// object 'tfs' is not defined in translation unit
extern FileSystem tfs;

class Directory {
public:
    Directory();
};

// object 'tfs' is used in constructor
Directory::Directory(){
    int d = tfs.foo1();
}

// object 'tfs' might be not initialized here
Directory tempDir;     // Violation

// examples of incorrect code:
extern int x;
int y = x;             // Violation

extern const int xc;
const int yc = xc;     // Violation

extern int ex;
int mode(){
    int k = ex;
    return k;
}
int ey = mode();       // Violation
