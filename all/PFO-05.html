DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

.c or .C files (implementation files) are intended to be
compiled on their own, and not included in other files.
This is a well accepted physical organization model for 
C and C++ code. 

Many build environments are set up
to automatically compile every .c file. If in addition a .c
file is included in another .c file, this will result in 
link errors.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Rule improves maintainability and readability of code, as 
well as prevents build errors.

EXAMPLE

//file.c
#include "file2.c"  // Violation

<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

1. Compile each .c file separately and link them.
2. Develop a convention for naming implementation files
to be included that does not use .c or .C extensions.
