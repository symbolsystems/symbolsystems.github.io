DESCRIPTION

<PRE>

"A pointer to an object or incomplete type may be converted to a pointer to
a different object or incomplete type. If the resulting pointer is not
correctly aligned for the referenced type, the behavior is undefined."
[ISO/IEC 9899:2011]

This rule detects when a pointer to an object type is cast to a pointer to
an object type which can be more strictly aligned.

<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule allows the following casts:
- from or to pointers to the 'void' type,
- to pointers to the 'char' type,
- between pointers to compatible types,
- between pointers to 'signed' and 'unsigned' versions of compatible
  types,
- between pointers to qualified or unqualified versions of compatible
  types.
It assumes that the above cases do not cause conversions to more strictly
aligned types.

This rule takes into account the 'alignas' attribute when the address of
an object is cast to the pointer type, for example:

void func() {
    alignas(int) char c = 'x';
    int *ip = (int *)&amp;c;        // OK
}

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"If the misaligned pointer is dereferenced, the program may terminate
abnormally. On some architectures, the cast alone may cause a loss of
information even if the value is not dereferenced if the types involved have
differing alignment requirements." [CERT-EXP36-C]

This rule helps you avoid undefined and implementation-defined behavior.
