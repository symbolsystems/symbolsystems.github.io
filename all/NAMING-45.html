Identifiers will not differ by mixture of case, the underscore character, interchange of the similarly looking letters and numbers [NAMING-45-3]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule reports a violation if two identifiers differ only in:
- a mixture of case, or
- the presence/absence of the underscore character, or
- the interchange of the letter 'O', with the number '0' or the letter 'D', or
- the interchange of the letter 'I', with the number '1' or the letter 'l', or
- the interchange of the letter 'S' with the number '5', or
- the interchange of the letter 'Z' with the number '2', or
- the interchange of the letter 'n' with the letter 'h'.

Identifiers are compared if:
- they are declared in nested scopes
- both are visible in the same scope

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Violation is reported only if the difference between identifiers is related
to only one category of differences specified in Description. For example:

   // difference in one category: mixture of case
   FOO, foo     // Violation

   // difference in two categories: mixture of case and presence/absence
   // of underscore character
   BAR, bar_    // OK



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule improves the readability of code.


Drawbacks

1. "using" directive is not supported. For example:
  namespace N {
    void foo();
  }
  namespace M {
    // no violation is reported even though both FOO and foo are visible here
    void FOO();
    using N::foo; // "using" not supported
  }

2. Identifiers declared in template functions are not checked

<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

void FOO();     // Violation - similar to 'foo'
int foo;        // Violation - similar to 'FOO' and 'foo_'
namespace N {
    void foo_();// Violation - similar to 'foo'
}

class A {
public:
    void mf();
private:
    int mem1;   // Violation - similar to 'meml' declared in member function
};

void A::mf() {
    int meml;   // Violation - similar to 'mem1' declared in class
}

// We treat members of derived classes as declared in a scope "nested" in scope
// of base class:
class Base {
    void IdZ();  // Violation - similar to 'Id2'
};
class Derived : public Base {
    void Id2();  // Violation - similar to 'IdZ'
};

// Because identifiers from base class are visible in derived classes, they
// are treated as implicitly declared in scope of derived class:
struct AnotherBase {
    int x;       // Violation - similar to 'x_'
};
namespace M {
    int x_;      // Violation - similar to 'x'
    struct AnotherDerived : public AnotherBase {
        void method() {
            // x can be used here
        }
    };
}

// Order of declarations is not checked - here 'Y' is declared in "outer" scope
// and 'y' is declared in "nested" scope:
void N2fun() {
    int y;           // Violation
}
int Y;               // Violation

void FOO2();     // OK - difference in more than one category with 'fooZ'
int fooZ;        // OK - difference in more than one category 'FOO2'

class A {

    void mf1();
    void mf2();
};

void A::mf1() {
    int mem1;    // OK - 'meml' is declared in separated scope (not nested)
}

void A::mf2() {
    int meml;    // OK - 'mem1' is declared in separated scope (not nested)
}

void fun() {
    int VAR;
    {
        int VAR; // OK - identifiers are the same, one hides the other
    }
}

namespace N1 {
    class Id2{}; // OK - 'IdZ' is declared in separated scope
}

namespace N2 {   // OK - 'Id2' is declared in separated scope
    int IdZ;
