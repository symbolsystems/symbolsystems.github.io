DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"All the members of a structure (or class/union) shall be named and shall only
be accessed via their names. Reading/writing to unnamed locations in memory
is error prone."

"Provided the elements of the structure are only ever accessed by their name,
the programmer needs to make no assumptions about the way the bit fields are
stored within the structure."

The rule reports a violation if an unnamed member variable of bit field type
is declared in class/struct/union.
