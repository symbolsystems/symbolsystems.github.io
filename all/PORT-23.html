Use arrays of int types instead of dynamic allocated large arrays of longs [PORT-23-5]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Large arrays of long or unsigned long types, can cause serious 
performance degradation in the LP64 data-type model as compared 
to arrays of int or unsigned int types. Large arrays of long types cause 
significantly more cache misses and consume more memory. 
Therefore, if int works just as well as long for the application purposes, 
it's better to use int rather than long." 
See also: PORT-22, PORT-24


Note: This rule checks for dynamic allocated arrays of longs that consist over 2^16-1
         elements.
