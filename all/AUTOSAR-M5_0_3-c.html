DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"The value of an expression of integer type shall not be implicitly
converted to a different underlying type.
The term 'underlying type' is defined as describing the type that would
be obtained from evaluating an expression if it were not for the effects
of integral promotion."
"The intention when restricting implicit conversion of complex expressions is
to require that in a sequence of arithmetic operations within an expression, 
all operations should be conducted in exactly the same arithmetic type."
Rule checks if implicit conversions of complex expressions are used.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"By observing the principle whereby all operations are performed in 
a consistent (underlying) type, it is possible to avoid programmer confusion 
and some of the dangers associated with integral promotion."



</PRE>
<STRONG>
DRAWBACKS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Rule checks only the simple expressions. Rule does not report any violations
if an expression is more complex.

EXAMPLE

<PRE>

void Conv1_int( )
{
    unsigned short u16a,u16b;
    unsigned int u32a = u16b + u16a;                      /* Violation */
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

void Conv1_int( )
{
    unsigned short u16a,u16b;
    unsigned int u32a = (unsigned int)(u16b + u16a);      /* OK */
}
