DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule reports "remark" severity level parser diagnostics.

Remarks indicate that something is valid and probably intended,
but a careful programmer may want to check it.

v10.1

<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule reports various kinds of violations. Each kind is identified
with a numeric ID.

For example:
  const static int x = 0; // Violation R-84: storage class is not first
  void foo(int i) {
    if (i); // Violation R-1815: empty dependent statement in if-statement
  }

The rule can be customized to disable or enable only some violations. 

By default all possible violations are enabled.

To disable violations with ID 84 and 225 use following properties file entry:
PARSER-REMARK-config=-84,225

The minus "-" at the beginning means "disable". Violation IDs are separated by
a comma ",".

To disable all violations except violation 225 and 1815 use following
properties file entry:
PARSER-REMARK-config=-*;+225,1815

The asterisk "*" means "all IDs". The semicolon ";" is used to separate the
"disable" group of IDs (the first group prefixed with a "-", consisting of "*")
and the "enable" group of IDs (consisting of IDs 226 and 1815). So the above 
can be read as "disable all; then enable 225, 1815".

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Parse remarks can detect possible bugs. Writing code without parser remarks
leads to a better and safer code.  



</PRE>
<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Here is an example that will trigger a violation:

const static int x = 0; // Violation R-84: storage class is not first
void foo(int i) {
    if (i); // Violation R-1815: empty dependent statement in if-statement
}
void bar() {
    // Compilable in C mode:
    undeclaredFunction(); // Violation R-225: function "undeclaredFunction" declared implicitly
}
