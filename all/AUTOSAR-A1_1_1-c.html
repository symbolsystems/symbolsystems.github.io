Both copy constructor and copy assignment operator should be declared for classes with a nontrivial destructor [AUTOSAR-A1_1_1-c-2]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

If you defined a non-trivial destructor, you should probably have a copy
constructor and copy assignment operator as well. 

"If you have to write a nontrivial destructor, it's often because you need to
manually release a resource that the object held. If so, it's likely that those
resources require careful duplication, and then you need to pay attention to the
way objects are copied and assigned, or disable copying completely" [1]

</PRE>
<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule only checks if the destructor is non-empty. It does not check if you
actually deallocate some resources there.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Following this rule prevents memory management problems.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

struct A /* Violation - missing copy constructor and copy assignment operator */
{
    int *p;
    ~A() {
        delete p;
    }
};

class B /* Violation - missing copy assignment operator */
{
    void doSth();
    ~B() {
        doSth();
    }
    B(const B&amp;) {}
};



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

struct A /* OK - copy constructor and copy assignment operator are declared */
{
    int *p;
    ~A() {
        delete p;
    }
    A(const A&amp;) {}
    A&amp; operator=(const A&amp;);
};
