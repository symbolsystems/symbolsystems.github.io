DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"No tag name shall be reused for any other purpose within the program.
ISO 9899:1990 does not define the behaviour when an aggregate declaration
uses a tag in different forms of type specifier." [MISRA C:2004]

A "tag" is a name of a class, struct, union or enum type.

This rule reports violation if there is a class, struct, union or enum type
declaration, and the name of the type is also used to declare a function,
parameter, variable or label.

See also: MISRA2004-5_4_b

<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

1. This rule does not check reuse of tag to declared a different tag:
    struct stag1 {
        int a;
    };
    void foo() {
        struct stag1 {  // OK - not checked by this rule
            float a;
        };
    }
This is checked by MISRA2004-5_4_b rule.

2. typedef names are not recognized as "tags" - a violation will be reported if
   a typedef name is the same as name of a tag:
    struct stag1 {
        int a;
    };
    typedef struct {
        int b;
    } stag1;            // Violation   
See also Exceptions section.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
EXCEPTIONS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"The tag name may be the same as the typedef name with which it is
associated." [MISRA C:2012]. Example:
    typedef struct stag1 {
        int a;
    } stag1;            // OK - Exception (same name of typedef and struct)



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Reuse of tag names can lead to errors and confusion.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
DRAWBACKS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

1. Rule checks only one translation unit at time. This means that if tag is
reused in a different translation unit then no violation will be reported.

</PRE>
<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>
    // file1.c:
    struct stag { int a; };      
    // file2.c
    void stag(void); // Violation not reported - struct stag declaration not
                     // visible in this translation unit


Example:

struct stag { int a; };      

void stag(void){}     // Violation - name of struct reused as name of a function



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

struct stag { int a; }; 

void foo(void){}      // OK
