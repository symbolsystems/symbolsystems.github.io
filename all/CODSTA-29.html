DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"When used in program logic, literals can reduce the readability of source code.
As a result, literals, in general, and integer constants, in particular,
are frequently called magic numbers because their purpose is often obscured.
Magic numbers can be constant values that represent either an arbitrary value
(such as a determined appropriate buffer size) or a malleable concept
(such as the age at which a person is considered an adult, which can change
between geopolitical boundaries). Rather than embed literals in program logic,
use appropriately named symbolic constants to clarify the intent of the code.
The C programming language has several mechanisms for creating named, symbolic
constants: const-qualified objects, enumeration constants, and object-like macro
definitions." [CERT DCL06-C]

This rule detects integer and floating constants with the following exceptions:
- Constants with '0' and '1' values are not detected independently from their
  representations.
- Constants used in initializers of enumeration constants or global variables
  are not detected.
- Constants used in macro and pragma definitions are not detected.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule is enabled for C code only.

"Although replacing numeric constants with a symbolic constant is often a good
practice, it can be taken too far. Remember that the goal is to improve
readability. Exceptions can be made for constants that are themselves
the abstraction you want to represent" [CERT DCL06-C]

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Using numeric literals makes code more difficult to read and understand.
Buffer overruns are frequently a consequence of a magic number being changed
in one place (such as in an array declaration) but not elsewhere (such as in
a loop through an array)." [CERT DCL06-C]

This rule helps you improve readability and maintainability of the code.

int array[255];       // Violation

void f(int i)

  if ( i &gt; 20 ) {     // Violation
    // ...

#define SIZE 255      // OK - exception

int array[SIZE] = {   // OK
    10, 20, 30        // OK - exception
};

const int limit = 20; // OK - exception

void f(int i)
{
  if ( i &gt; limit ) {  // OK
    // ...
  }

  for (i = 0; i &lt; limit; i++) { // OK - exception
    //...
  }

  if ( i &gt; -1 &amp;&amp; i &lt; 1 ) {      // OK - exception
    // ...
