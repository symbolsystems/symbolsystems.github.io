DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"The prefix and postfix forms of these operators return different types.
In particular, prefix forms return a reference, postfix forms return
a const object. Let us make one more observation about the prefix and postfix
increment operators. Except for their return values, they do the same thing:
they increment a value. That is, they're supposed to do the same thing. 
How can you be sure the behavior of postfix increment is consistent with
that of prefix increment? What guarantee do you have that their implementations
won't diverge over time, possibly as a result of different programmers
maintaining and enhancing them? Unless you've followed the design principle 
embodied by the code below, you have no such guarantee. That principle is that
postfix increment and decrement should be implemented in terms of their prefix
counterparts. You then need only maintain the prefix versions, 
because the postfix versions will automatically behave in a consistent fashion."
