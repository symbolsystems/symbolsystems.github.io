Protected member function shall not return non-const handles to private class-data [OOP-12-3]
</STRONG>
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>
DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"By implementing class interfaces with member functions the implementation
retains more control over how the object state can be modified and helps
to allow a class to be maintained without affecting clients.
Returning a handle to class-data allows for clients to modify the state
of the object without using any interfaces."
The rule reports a violation if a protected member function returns non-const 
reference or pointer to private class-data.
See also: CODSTA-CPP-06, CODSTA-CPP-77, OOP-36



</PRE>
<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Handle to class-data is:
- reference to member variable/member function
- pointer to member variable/member function
- pointer/reference to data allocated in constructor or deallocated in destructor
Static variables are not considered class-data.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Rule improves encapsulation and prevents from data changing in ways not 
intended by the class designer.

class Test
{
    public:
        Test()
        {
            _k = new int; // makes data pointed by _k a "class-data"
        }
