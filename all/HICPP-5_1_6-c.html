DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"A possible programming error in C is to apply the sizeof operator
to an expression and expect the expression to be evaluated. 
However the expression is not evaluated: sizeof only acts on the type
of the expression. To avoid this error, sizeof shall not be used
on expressions that contain side effects, as the side effects
will not occur." [MISRA C:2004 Rule 12.3]

"Accessing a volatile object, modifying an object, modifying a file,
or calling a function that does any of those operations are all side
effects, which are changes in the state of the execution environment."
[ISO/IEC 9899:1999]

"When a function is called, it may have side effects. Modifying a file
or accessing a volatile object are persistent as viewed by the calling
function. However any objects modified by the called function, whose 
lifetimes have ended by the time it returns, do not affect the caller's
execution state. Any side effects arising from modifying such objects
are not persistent as viewed by the caller." [MISRA C:2012 Appendix J]

The rule reports a violation if in the operand of the sizeof operator
is called the function that has a persistent side effect.

EXAMPLE

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int glob;

int foo1() {            // Function 'foo1' causes side effect
    glob = 100;
    return glob;
}

int foo2() {            // Function 'foo2' causes side effect
    static int st_loc;
    st_loc = 100;
    return st_loc;
}

int foo3(int* ptr) {    // Function 'foo3' causes side effect
    *ptr = 100;
    return ptr;
}

void foo_s(int p) {
    unsigned int ui;
    ui = sizeof(foo1());             // Violation
    ui = sizeof(foo2());             // Violation
    ui = sizeof(foo3(&amp;p));           // Violation
    ui = sizeof(printf("message"));  // Violation

</STRONG>
<PRE>
int foo1();          // Function 'foo1' may cause side effect or not

int foo2(int x) {    // Function 'foo2' does not cause side effect

int foo3() {         // Function 'foo3' does not cause side effect
