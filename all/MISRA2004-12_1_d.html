DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"In addition to the use of parentheses to override default operator precedence,
parentheses should also be used to emphasise it. It is easy to make a mistake 
with the rather complicated precedence rules of C, and this approach helps to 
avoid such errors, and helps to make the code easier to read. However, do not 
add too many parentheses so as to clutter the code and make it unreadable."
"If all operators are the same, parentheses may be used to control the order of 
operation. Some operators (e.g. addition and multiplication) that are 
associative in algebra are not necessarily associative in C. Similarly, integer 
operations involving mixed types (prohibited by several rules) may produce 
different results because of the integral promotions. The following example 
written for a 16-bit implementation demonstrates that addition is not 
associative and that it is important to be clear about the structure of an 
expression:"
