Do not slice derived objects [CERT_CPP-OOP51-a-3]

DESCRIPTION

<PRE>

"Do not initialize an object of base class type with an object of derived class
type, except through references, pointers, or pointer-like abstractions (such as
std::unique_ptr, or std::shared_ptr).

An object deriving from a base class typically contains additional member
variables that extend the base class. When by-value assigning or copying
an object of the derived type to an object of the base type, those additional
member variables are not copied because the base class contains insufficient
space in which to store them. This action is commonly called slicing the object
because the additional members are 'sliced off' the resulting object."
[CERT-OOP51-CPP]

This rule detects when an expression of a derived class with virtual functions
or additional member variables relative to the base class is assigned
to the base object class by value.

This rule helps you prevent the slicing problem, and improve code consistency
and runtime performance.
