DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"This rule requires that, when a macro is being defined, its name be distinct 
from:
- the names of the other macros that are currently defined; and
- the names of their parameters.

It also requires that the names of the parameters of a given macro be distinct
from each other but does not require that macro parameters names be distinct
across two different macros.

The definition of distinct depends on the implementation and the version
of the C language that is being used:
- In C90 the minimum requirement is that the first 31 characters
  are significant" [MISRA C:2012 Rule 5.4]

This rule detects cases when:
- a macro has the same name (or the first 31 characters of the name) as one of
  its parameters;
- the parameters of a macro have the same names (or the first 31 characters of
  their names).

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Long macro identifiers may impair the readability of code. While many automatic
code generation systems produce long macro identifiers, there is a good argument
for keeping macro identifier lengths well below this limit."
[MISRA C:2012 Rule 5.4]

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Macros and identifiers whose names are the same may confuse the developer and
lead to undefined behavior of the program. This rule helps keep macro names and
identifiers distinct.
