DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Member variable names shall be in proper lowercase.
This rule checks only first character of the identifier and reports a violation
if the character is not a lowercase letter (a-z).
 
By standardizing the appearance of variables, 
the programmer will be able to more easily differentiate 
user-defined variables from constants.

EXCEPTIONS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Joint Strike Fighter coding standard allows uppercase letters in acronyms.
For example:
  int RGB_value;   // OK if "RGB" is an acronym
  int UTF8;        // OK if "UTF8" is an acronym
The acronym should be separated from the rest of the identifier with
an underscore. For example:
  int RGBvalue;    // Violation even if RGB is an acronym

To support this exception set CPPTEST_JSF_ACRONYMS environment variable to the
path to a text file containing whitespace-separated list of words. Each word
is recognized as an acronym. Example content of the file:
   RGB
   UTF8

If the CPPTEST_JSF_ACRONYMS is not set or the file could not be opened, the rule
works as if there were no acronyms at all. Opening file errors are silently
ignored.
