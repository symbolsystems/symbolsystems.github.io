DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"An explicit cast may be introduced for legitimate functional reasons.
However, some explicit casts are considered inappropriate:
- Converting between floating and character types is not meaningful
  as there is no precise mapping between the two representations."
  [MISRA C:2012 Rule 10.5]

This rule detect cases when: 
- an expression of an essentially floating type is explicitly cast
  to an essentially character type
- an expression of an essentially character type is explicitly cast
  to an essentially floating type

The term "essential type" is defined by the MISRA C:2012 standard.

void foo()

    double complex dc;

    (float)ch;                         /* Violation */
    (double)'A';                       /* Violation */
    (float complex)'B';                /* Violation */
    (char)1.2;                         /* Violation */
    (char)f;                           /* Violation */
    (char)dc;                          /* Violation */
