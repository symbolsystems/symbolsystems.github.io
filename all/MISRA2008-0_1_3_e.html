DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Variables declared and never used in a project constitute noise and may
indicate that the wrong name has been used somewhere. Removing these
declarations reduces the possibility that they may later be used instead
of the correct variable." [MISRA C++:2008 Rule 0-1-3]

This rule detects variables with internal linkage that are not used
in a translation unit.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Objects of non-POD type can perform some actions in their constructors.
Even if they are not used later they might have done their job during
creation. This rule considers such objects as used.

This rule considers variables to be of POD type according to the definition
of POD (Plain Old Data) specified in:
- the MISRA C++:2008 (Appendix C) standard
- the C++ ISO/IEC 14882:1998 standard (for cases not defined by MISRA C++:2008)

The rule does not trigger on variables captured by lambda expressions. 
It assumes that lambdas use every variable they capture.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule improves legibility and increases the efficiency of code.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

static int var1;   /* Violation */
static int var3;   /* Violation */

int addVar1toVar2(int var2)
{
  return var2 + var2;
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

/* You can fix the code by removing the unused variable or by using it */

static int var1;   /* OK */

int addVar1toVar2(int var2)
{
  return var1 + var2;
}
