Adhere to convention when writing new and delete [MRM-12-3]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"For operator delete, things are simpler. About all you need to remember is
that C++ guarantees it's always safe to delete the null pointer, so you need
to honor that guarantee.
The member version of this function is simple, too, except you've got to be
sure to check the size of what's being deleted. Assuming your class-specific
operator new forwards requests of the "wrong" size to ::operator new, you've
got to forward "wrongly sized" deletion requests to ::operator delete."

#include &lt;iostream&gt;

class Base {

    if (rawMemory == 0) return;
    // deallocate the memory pointed to by rawMemory;
    return;
}

void operator delete( void* rawMemory ) throw( ) {                      // Violation
