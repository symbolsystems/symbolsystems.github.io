Do not use dynamic type of an object under construction [HICPP-12_4_1-b-2]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Dynamic type of the object under construction is not resolved to the most derived class.
Instead, it is always resolved to the type in which the constructor is declared.
This may lead to developer confusion and make code error-prone.

Additionally, a call to a pure virtual function from a constructor results in
undefined behavior.

By default, this rule detects when a dynamic type of an object under
construction is directly or indirectly used from inside a constructor
for one of the following purposes:
 - Making a virtual call to a virtual function.
 - Using dynamic_cast.
 - Using typeid on the object of a polymorphic class type.
 
The rule can be parameterized; see PARAMETERS.

v10.1


</PRE>
<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>
The rule does not report the use of the dynamic type of an object inside
an otherwise reported virtual method call.

The rule does not trigger when the virtual function is called using a class
qualifier or when a final override of a virtual function is called.

See EXAMPLE.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
SECURITY RELEVANCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>
As a rule, using dynamic type of the object under construction is error-prone and
may lead to defects ranging from memory leaks to program crashes.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>
The "Report calls to virtual functions" parameter allows you to specify if
the rule triggers when a virtual call to a virtual function is made on
the object under construction from inside a constructor.
It is enabled by default.

The "Report only when calling pure virtual functions" sub-parameter
allows you to narrow down calls to virtual functions the rule will report.
If enabled, the rule only triggers on calls to pure virtual functions.
It is disabled by default.

The "Report uses of dynamic_cast" parameter allows you to specify if the rule
triggers when a dynamic_cast is used on the object under construction from
inside a constructor.
It is enabled by default.

The "Report uses of typeid on the object of a polymorphic class type" parameter
allows you to specify if the rule triggers when typeid is used on the object
under construction of a polymorphic class type from inside a constructor.
It is enabled by default.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>
This rule helps you avoid undefined behavior and code defects ranging from
memory leaks to program crashes.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

class Test {
public:
    Test()
    {
        nv();
        v2();       // VIOLATION
        Test::v4(); // NO VIOLATION
        v5();       // NO VIOLATION - call to a final override
    }
    
    void nv()
    {
        v1();       // VIOLATION
    }

    virtual void v1();
    virtual void v2()
    {
        v3();       // NO VIOLATION - call to v2() reported in Test::Test()
    }
    virtual void v3();
    virtual void v4();
    virtual void v5() final;
};

Test* createTest()
{
    return new Test();
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>
To fix the code, do not call virtual functions on the object under
construction. One way to avoid this is to execute the post-initialization code
after the object is fully created.

class Test {
public:
    Test()
    {
    }

    void postInitialize()
    {
        nv();
        v2();       // NO VIOLATION
        Test::v4(); // NO VIOLATION
        v5();       // NO VIOLATION
    }
    
    void nv()
    {
        v1();       // NO VIOLATION
    }

    virtual void v1();
    virtual void v2()
    {
        v3();       // NO VIOLATION
    }
    virtual void v3();
    virtual void v4();
    virtual void v5() final;
};

Test* createTest()
{
    Test* test = new Test();
    test-&gt;postInitialize();
    return test;
}
