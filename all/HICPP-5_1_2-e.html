DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Apart from a few operators (notably the function call operator (), &amp;&amp;, ||, ?:
and , (comma)) the order in which sub-expressions are evaluated is unspecified
and can vary. This means that no reliance can be placed on the order of
evaluation of sub-expressions, and in particular no reliance can be placed on
the order in which side effects occur."

"Between the previous and next sequence point an object shall have its stored
value modified at most once by the evaluation of an expression."

The rule reports a violation if an object is modified (incremented,
decremented or assigned) more than once between sequence points.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The use of increment and decrement operators in combination with other 
arithmetic operators is not recommended. When the increment or decrement
operator is used, it should be the only side-effect in the statement.

Assignments nested within expressions cause additional side effects. The best 
way to avoid any chance of this leading to a dependence on order of evaluation 
is to not embed assignments within expressions.

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule prevents undefined behaviours.

EXAMPLE

void foo1(){
    int i, j;
    i = ++i + 1;   // Violation
    j = ++i + i--; // Violation
}

REPAIR

<PRE>

void foo1(){
    int i, j;
    ++i;       // OK
    i += 1;    // OK
    ++i;       // OK
    j = i + i; // OK
    i--;       // OK
}

int foo_int(int);
void foo_m(int p){
    int i;

    i = 0, i++;       // OK - there is a sequence point between modifications
    p = foo_int(p++); // OK - there is a sequence point between modifications
    if(i++ &amp;&amp; i--);   // OK - there is a sequence point between modifications
}
