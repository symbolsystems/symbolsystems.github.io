DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"The address of an object becomes indeterminate when the lifetime of that object
expires. Any use of an indeterminate address results in undefined behaviour."
[MISRA C:2012]

The rule detects when the address of an object with thread storage duration
is assigned to an object with static storage duration.

<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"An object whose identifier is declared with the storage-class specifier
_Thread_local has thread storage duration. Its lifetime is the entire execution
of the thread for which it is created, and its stored value is initialized when
the thread is started." [ISO/IEC 9899:2011]



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule helps you prevent undefined behavior.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
DRAWBACKS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule does not check control flow. For example, a violation will not be
reported if the address of an object with thread-local storage is first
assigned to a local pointer and then that pointer is assigned to another
pointer of wider scope.

#include "threads.h"

int* gptr;

void foo() {
    static thread_local int thlocal;
    int* lptr;
    lptr = &amp;thlocal;
    gptr = lptr;                                   // Not reported
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

#include "threads.h"

int* gptr;

void func(void *id)
{
    static thread_local int thlocal;
    gptr = &amp;thlocal;                               // Violation
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Do not assign the address of an object to another object of wider scope.
