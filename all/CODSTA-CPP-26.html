DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"We've all had those days, and the odds are decent that the mystery culprit was
some form of the aforementioned problem, where ADL pulled in names from other 
namespaces inappropriately just because types from those namespaces were being 
used nearby.
This problem is not unique to uses of the standard library. It can and does 
happen in C++ with the use of any type that is defined in the same namespace 
as functions - especially templated functions, and most especially operators - 
that aren't specifically related to that type. Don't do that.
The easiest way to avoid this whole category of problems is to in general avoid
putting nonmember functions that are not part of the interface of a type X into
the same namespace as X, and especially never ever put templated functions or 
operators into the same namespace as a user-defined type."

This rule prevents from mysterious and incomprehensible compiler errors, 
mainly when the standard library is used.

namespace NS1 {
    class Class {};
    void foo01( );          // Violation
    void foo02( int x );    // Violation
    void foo03( Class x );  // OK
    void foo04( Class* x ); // OK
}
