DESCRIPTION

<PRE>

"The result of equality comparison between pointer to member virtual function
and anything other than null-pointer-constant is unspecified."
[AUTOSAR A5-10-1]

This rule detects when the address of a virtual member function is used
as an operand of an equality operator (== or !=).

<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule doesn't trigger when a pointer to a virtual member function
is compared with a null-pointer-constant (nullptr).

This rule doesn't trigger when an indirect pointer to a virtual member
function is used as an operand of an equality operator.

For example, the following code will not trigger the rule:

class C {
public:
    virtual void vfoo();
};

void bar() {
    void (C::*fp)() = &amp;C::vfoo;
    if (fp == 0) { }             // No violation
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule helps you prevent unspecified results.

<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

class C {
public:
    virtual void vfoo();
    void foo();
};

void bar() {
    if (&amp;C::vfoo == 0) {                  // Violation
    }
    if (&amp;C::vfoo != &amp;C::foo) {            // Violation
    }
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

To fix the code, do not compare a pointer to the virtual member function
with anything except a null-pointer-constant (nullptr).

class C {
public:
    virtual void vfoo();
    void foo();
};

void bar() {
    if (&amp;C::vfoo == nullptr) {            // OK
    }
}
