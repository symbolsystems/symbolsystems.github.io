DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Line-splicing occurs when the \ character is immediately followed by a new-line
character. 

If the source line containing a // comment ends with a \ character in the source
character set, the next line becomes part of the comment. This may result in
unintentional removal of code." [MISRA C:2012 Rule 3.2]

BENEFITS

<PRE>

Prevents unintentional removal of code.

DRAWBACKS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

During preprocessing, before the line-splicing, following phase occurs:

"Physical source file multibyte characters are mapped, in an implementation-
defined manner, to the source character set (introducing new-line characters for
end-of-line indicators) if necessary. Trigraph sequences are replaced by
corresponding single-character internal representations."

This phase is not supported - if backslash or new-line is a result of multibyte
character mapping or trigraph sequence replacing, this rule will not recognize
it and will not report a violation.

You can enable rule MISRA2004-4_2 which reports a violation if trigraphs are
used.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

// This examples shows that it's easy to have a comment which ends with a
// backslash and change the meaning of the code:

// The backslashCount variable is not declared and the next line results
// in a Violation:
// Count number of backslashes: \
extern int backslashCount;

void foo(char *p)
{
  // Due to backslash in the comment, the "return" is always execucted!
  // The next line results in a Violation:
  // Check if pointer is not a backslash character: \
  if (p &amp;&amp; *p == '\\')
  {
    return;
  }

  // Following code will never be executed
  // ...
}

// This rule reports a violation also if there is no code after the comment
// with a backslash:
// Violation \



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

// Modify the comment, for example remove the trailing backslash:
// Count number of backslashes:
extern int backslashCount;

void foo(char *p)
{
  // You can move it so it's not the last character:
  // Check if pointer is not a backslash '\' character:
  if (p &amp;&amp; *p == '\\')
  {
    return;
  }
  //...
}

/* Only  C++-style comments are checked, this backslash is not a violation: \
 */
