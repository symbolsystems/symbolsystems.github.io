DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule reports when the class or struct:
* has a protected non-static data member, or
* has non-static data members with different access specifiers.

SINCE

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule helps you improve code readability by differentiating between classes
which contain logic and classes that group data members without defining
any invariants.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

struct S // Violation
{
    int a;
protected:
    int b;
private:
    int c;
};

class C1 // Violation
{
protected:
    int a;
};

class C2 // OK - static members are not subject to this rule
{
    int a;
public:
    static int staticA;
};



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

struct S // OK
{
    int a;
    int b;
    int c;
};

class C1 // OK - private members can be exposed by protected or public methods
{
    int a;
protected:
    int getA();
};

class C2 // OK - static members are not subject to this rule
{
    int a;
public:
    static int staticA;
};
