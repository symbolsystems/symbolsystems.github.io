Floating-point expressions shall not be tested for equality or inequality [CERT_C-FLP02-a-3]
</STRONG>

<STRONG>
DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Floating-point expressions shall not be tested for equality or inequality.
The recommended method for achieving deterministic floating-point comparisons is
to write a library that implements the comparison operations. The library should
take into account the floating-point granularity (FLT_EPSILON) and the magnitude
of the numbers being compared."



</PRE>
<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Rule does not detect indirect tests of equality and inequality which are equally
problematic and are also forbidden by Misra standard:

if ( ( x &lt;= y ) &amp;&amp; ( x &gt;= y ) )
{
  /* ... */ 
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"The inherent nature of floating-point types is such that comparisons of 
equality will often not evaluate to true even when they are expected to. In 
addition the behaviour of such a comparison cannot be predicted before 
execution, and may well vary from one implementation to another. "

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

void foo() {
    float x, y;

    if (x == y);      // Violation
    if (x == 0.0f);   // Violation
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

void foo( float epsilon ) {
    float x, y;

    if (x - epsilon &lt;= y &amp;&amp; y &lt;= x + epsilon);  // OK
    if (-epsilon &lt;= x &amp;&amp; x &lt;= epsilon);         // OK
}
