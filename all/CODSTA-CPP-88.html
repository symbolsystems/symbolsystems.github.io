DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"In a given scope, a typedef specifier can be used to redefine the name of any
type declared in that scope to refer to the type to which it already refers."
[ISO/IEC 14882]

For ease of use, C++ doesn't require that a type name be prefixed with
the keywords class, struct, union or enum when used in object declarations
or type casts, so the use of a typedef with the same name as its basic type
is not reasonable.

The rule reports a violation if a direct typedef to class, struct, union 
or enum type has the same name as its basic type.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule improves readability and efficiency of code.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
DRAWBACKS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule reports a violation if a typedef is defined as extern "C".

extern "C" typedef struct cc {int x; int y;} cc; // Violation is reported

<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

typedef struct vector {int x; int y;} vector;     // Violation



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

struct vector {int x; int y;};        // OK
typedef struct S {int x; int y;} ST;  // OK - typedef has different name
typedef ST S;                         // OK - only direct typedef is checked
