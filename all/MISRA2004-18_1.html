All structure and union types shall be complete at the end of a translation unit [MISRA2004-18_1-3]
</STRONG>
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>
DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"A complete declaration of the structure or union shall be included within
any translation unit that reads from or writes to that structure.
A pointer to an incomplete type is itself complete and is permitted,
and therefore the use of opaque pointers is permitted"
References are treated the same way as pointers so the use of opaque
references is permitted as well.

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Rule prevents undefined behaviour and improves readability 
and maintainability of code

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

extern struct st *pst1;
extern struct st *pst2;

void mc2_1801 ( void )
{
//   struct st1 s;       /* Violation - not compilable with all compilers */

   struct {
      int a;
      int b [ ];        /* Violation */
   } mc2_1801_st = { 1, { 2, 3, 4 } };

   pst2 = pst1;         /* OK - Use of opaque pointer */

//   *pst2 = *pst1;       /* Violation - not compilable with all compilers */
}
