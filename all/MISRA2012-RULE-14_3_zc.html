DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>
This rule identifies conditions that always evaluate to the same value. Such conditions
often appear in the course of refactoring and during code evolution - especially when
code is edited by multiple developers. Often, the existence of such conditions indicates
logical errors in code (as shown below in the Example section). Additionally, such conditions
may indicate overly loose assumptions, which results in less efficient code and fragments
of dead code.
This rule analyzes top-level conditions and sub-conditions in:
- if statements (except constexpr if statements)
- switch statements
- while loops
- for loops
- do...while loops
- ternary operator

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>
When both the condition and the code that makes this condition constant are within
the same method, this almost always indicates a problem with the logic. When
one of them is in a different method, a more careful review is needed before
proceeding to fix the reported violation. Even though an obvious solution may be
to remove the check, it is possible that the check protects against future changes.

When the "Report violations on inner conditions" parameter is turned on, some 
violations usually need additional analysis to be fully understood. For example:

void test(int a)
{
    if (a &gt; 3 &amp;&amp; a &gt; 2) { // Violation Condition "a &gt; 2" always evaluates to true
    }
}

This example does not show that condition "a &gt; 2" will be always true at the function
entry. It shows that if condition "a &gt; 2" is evaluated, it always evaluates to true.
The condition will only be evaluated if "a &gt; 3" is fulfilled.

<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>
The "Report violations on inner conditions" parameter enables reporting violations on 
sub-conditions. If the parameter is turned off, the rule will report only on top-level 
controlling expressions.
This option is enabled by default.

The "Report violations when a constant value is used as a condition" parameter enables 
reporting violations when a constant value is used as a controlling expression.
This option is disabled by default.
The "Except when:" set of parameters helps you reduce the number of violations when 
"Report violations when a constant value is used as a condition" is enabled:
- If "Literal 'true' or '1' is used to define potentially infinite loop" is enabled, the rule 
will not report when literal 'true' or '1' is used as a loop condition.
- If "Literal 'false' or '0' is used as a controlling expression of a do-while loop" is enabled,
 the rule will not report when literal 'false' or '0' is used as a do-while loop condition.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>
This rule helps you keep your code in good shape and eliminate logical
inconsistencies as soon as they are introduced.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Here is an example which triggers a violation:

#include "stdio.h"

void processHexValue(char*);

static void checkRange(char* cur)
{
    if ((*cur &lt; '0') || (*cur &gt; '9')) {
        printf("Error: only digits are permitted");
        return;
    }
    // obviously dead code
    if ((*cur &gt;= 'a') &amp;&amp; (*cur &lt;= 'f')) { // Violation
        processHexValue(cur);
    }
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>
To repair the code, remove the redundant check:

#include "stdio.h"

static void checkRange(char* cur)
{
    if ((*cur &lt; '0') || (*cur &gt; '9')) {
        printf("Error: only decimal digits are permitted");
        return;
    }
}
