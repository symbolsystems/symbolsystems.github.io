Adhere to convention when writing new [MRM-13-3]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

When you write operator new, this rule checks to make sure that you are
consistent with the default new. "In practical terms, this means having the
right return value, calling an error-handling function when insufficient
memory is available, and being prepared to cope with requests for no memory.

Curiously, C++ requires that operator new return a legitimate pointer even
when zero bytes are requested. That being the case, pseudocode for a
non-member operator new looks like this:

void * operator new(std::size_t size) throw(std::bad_alloc)
{ // your operator new might
  using namespace std; // take additional params

  if (size == 0) { // handle 0-byte requests
     size = 1;     // by treating them as
  }                // 1-byte requests

/* ... */
}

(...) given an operator new for a class X, the behavior of that function is
typically tuned for objects of size sizeof(X)—nothing larger and nothing
smaller. Because of inheritance, however, it is possible that the operator new
in a base class will be called to allocate memory for an object of a derived
class:

class Base {
 public:
    static void * operator new(std::size_t size) throw(std::bad_alloc);
 ...
};

class Derived: public Base // Derived doesn't declare
{ ... }; // operator new

Derived *p = new Derived; // calls Base::operator new!

If Base's class-specific operator new wasn't designed to cope with this — and
chances are that it wasn't — the best way for it to handle the situation is to
slough off calls requesting the "wrong" amount of memory to the standard
operator new, like this:

void * Base::operator new(std::size_t size) throw(std::bad_alloc)
{
   if (size != sizeof(Base))       // if size is "wrong,"
      return ::operator new(size); // have standard operator
                                   // new handle the request
   ... 
}

If you do not adhere to convention when you write new, you may cause 
confusing inconsistencies for users of your new and delete operators.
