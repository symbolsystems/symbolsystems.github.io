DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule detects "public" data members that could be accessed 
by untrusted code.
Only "class" types are checked ("struct" and "union" are not checked).
See also: OOP-19



</PRE>
<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Rule skips 'static const' variables.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Prevents the use of "public" data members. Public data members can be directly 
accessed by any user code. 
Using public accessor member functions to return data instead 
will prevent unauthorized access.

class A {
private:
    int iData;      // OK
public:
