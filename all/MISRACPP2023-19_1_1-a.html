DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"The only two permissible forms for the 'defined' preprocessor operator are:
  - defined ( identifier )
  - defined identifier
Any other form is a constraint violation, but this is not reported by all
compliers." [MISRA C++:2008]

"Generation of the token defined during expansion of a #if or #elif
preprocessing directive also leads to undefined behaviour and shall
be avoided" [MISRA C++:2008]

This rule detects when:
- the 'defined' preprocessor operator used in #if or #elif directive is not
  followed by a single identifier or opening parenthesis, or
- a macro containing the 'defined' preprocessor operator is expanded
  in #if or #elif directive (only if the macro was previously defined
  in the same file using the #define directive).

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule helps you avoid undefined behavior.
