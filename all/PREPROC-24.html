DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"If an attempt is made to use an identifier in a preprocessor directive,
and that identifier has not been defined, the preprocessor will sometimes
not give any warning but will assume the value zero. 
'#ifdef', '#ifndef' and 'defined()' are provided to test the existence
of a macro, and are therefore excluded.

Note that preprocessing identifiers may be defined either by use of #define
directives or by options specified at compiler invocation. However the use
of the #define directive is preferred." [MISRA C:2004 Rule 19.11]

The violation is reported by the rule if the macro identifier is used
in #if/#elif directive (except as operands to the 'defined' operator)
and it is possible the macro is not defined. 

The rule assumes that macro identifier is defined only if:

1. it was previously defined via #define directive. The definition must be
   unconditional. For example:
   #ifdef UNIX
   #  define MACRO1 1
   #  define MACRO2 2
   #else
   #  define MACRO1 -1
   #endif
   /* MACRO1 is defined, MACRO2 is assumed to be not defined */

2. or if it is used in context of preprocessor directive #ifdef, #ifndef, #if, 
   or #elif which checks if the macro identifier was previously defined.
   For example:
   #ifdef MACRO
      /* MACRO is defined */
   #endif

In both cases the #define or #ifdef (or similar) checks must be in the same
file as the macro use. For example:
   /* --- file.h --- */
   #define MACRO
   /* --- file.c --- */
   #include "file.h"
   /* MACRO is assumed to be not defined */

<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

If #undef is used in any branch of #if/#elif/#else, the macro is assumed to be
not defined. For example:
   #define MACRO
   #ifdef UNIX
   #  undef MACRO
   #endif
   /* MACRO is assumed to be not defined even if UNIX macro is not defined */



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule prevents using undefined macros in #if and #elif directives, which may
be undetected if the preprocessor does not give any warnings.

<STRONG>
DRAWBACKS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

1. Logical expressions in #if/#elif are not supported. For example:
   #if defined(MACRO) &amp;&amp; MACRO &gt; 0 /* MACRO is assumed to be not defined and */
   #endif                          /* a violation will be reported */
   #if defined(MACRO1) &amp;&amp; !defined(MACRO2)
   /* Both MACRO1 and MACRO2 are assumed to be not defined and usage of those */
   /* macros will result in a violation */
   #endif

2. Only simple analysis of control flow is performed. For example:
   #define MACRO1
   #ifdef MACRO1
   #define MACRO2
   #endif
   /* MACRO2 is assumed to be undefined */

3. Predefined and command line macros are not supported and any use of such
   macros must be preceded with checking if they are defined.
