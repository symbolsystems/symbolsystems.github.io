Always assign a new value to global or member variable that points to deallocated memory [CERT_C-MEM01-c-2]

<STRONG>
DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

All pointers should be set to either 0 or to a valid address immediately
after delete statement. 
The rule reports a violation if directly after delete used on a global
or member variable there is no assignment to this variable. 
See also: MRM-09, MRM-11, MRM-31



</PRE>
<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Violation is not reported if delete is used on a non-static member
variable in destructor.
Some violations can be not reported on MSVC compiler
if an assignment is used before delete statement inside macro.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Rule prevents accessing a pointer or a reference to a deleted object.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

int* p;
int* q;
void foo(){
    p = new int;
    q = new int(5);
    //....
    delete p;	// Violation - set deleted pointer in next expression
    delete q;	// Violation - set deleted pointer in next expression
    p = 0;
    q = new int(10);
    //...
    delete q;    // Violation - set deleted pointer to 0
}

class A {
public:
    A();
    ~A();
    void clear();
    int* ptr;
};

A::A(){
    ptr = new int(10);
}

void A::clear(){
    delete ptr;    // Violation - set deleted pointer to 0
}

<PRE>

int* p;
int* q;
void foo(){
    p = new int;
    q = new int(5);
    //....
    delete p;	// OK
    p = 0;
    delete q;	// OK
    q = new int(10);
    //...
    delete q;	// OK
    q = 0;
}

class A {
public:
    A();
    ~A();
    void clear();
    int* ptr;
};

A::A(){
    ptr = new int(10);
}

A::~A(){
    delete ptr;    // OK - exception
}

void A::clear(){
    delete ptr;    // OK
    ptr = 0;
}
