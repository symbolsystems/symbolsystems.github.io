DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule reports a violation if a result of an assignment operator is used. The
assignment should be a separate (top-level) expression.

Both simple (=) and compound (*=, /=, %=, +=, -=, &gt;&gt;=, &lt;&lt;=, &amp;=, Ë†=, |=)
operators are checked.

Only built-in assignment operators are checked - C++ overloaded operators
( for example operator= ) are not checked.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Violation is not reported in following cases:
- top-level comma operator:
  i = 0, j = 0, k = 0;       // OK
  x + (i = 0, j = 0, k = 0); // Violation
- top-level 'for' initialization and increment sections:
  for ( i = 0; ; i = 0 );    // OK
  for (; i = 0; );           // Violation
  for (;; i + (j = 0) );     // Violation

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"The use of assignment operators, simple or compound, in combination with other
arithmetic operators is not recommended because:
- It can significantly impair the readability of the code;
- It introduces additional side effects into a statement making it more
  difficult to avoid the undefined behaviour" [MISRA C:2012 Rule 13.4]

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

// Examples of non-compliant code:

int g;
int foo(int i)
{
  int j[ i = 10 ];      // Violation
  foo( i += 1 );        // Violation
  if( i &lt; 0 || (i = g));// Violation
  while(i = 10);        // Violation
  g = i = 2;            // Violation
  sizeof(i &lt;&lt;= 2);      // Violation
  return i *= 2;        // Violation
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

int g;
int foo(int i)
{
  // Usually the compliant code uses separate assignment statement:
  i = 2;
  g = i;
  if( i &lt; 0 || g)
    i = g;
}
