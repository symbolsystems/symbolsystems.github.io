DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Most compiler implementations use virtual tables (vtbl) to implement virtual
functions. There have to be one vtbl for a class. It have to be placed
somewhere. It's compiler dependent, but some implementations put vtbl in object
file that contains definition of first non-inline non-pure virtual function.
If all virtual functions are inline compiler does not have one place to put
vtbl - it puts it in all objects that use virtualness of the class.
This increases size of object files.
The simplest solutions is not to make virtual functions inline.

<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Inline destructors defined in interfaces are allowed.
By interface class is meant class which has no member variables
and all member functions (except for destructor) are pure virtual.
"All the destructor calls except for the initial resolution are resolved
statically. Without making the base class virtual destructors inline,
we cannot take advantage of this. If the hierarchy is deep and there
are many objects destructed, it make much of a difference"



</PRE>
<STRONG>
EXCEPTIONS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule does not report violations on template functions.
Compiler must know the body of a template function. It instantiates and puts
implementation in each object that uses it. Thus, removing inline does not help
because virtual table is still put in each object that uses it.

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"The size of a class's vtbl is proportional to the number of virtual functions
declared for that class (including those it inherits from its base classes).
There should be only one virtual table per class, so the total amount of space
required for virtual tables is not usually significant, but if you have a large
number of classes or a large number of virtual functions in each class, you may
find that the vtbls take a significant bite out of your address space.
If all virtual functions in a class are declared inline, the most implementations
then generate a copy of the class's in every object file that uses it. 
In large systems, this can lead to programs containing hundreds or thousands
of copies of a class's!"

EXAMPLE

<PRE>

class A
{
public:
   A(int i) : _i( i ) {}
   virtual ~A( ) {}         // Violation

private:
   int _i;
};

REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

class A
{
public:
    A( int i ) : _i( i ) {}
    virtual ~A( );          // OK

private:
    int _i;
};

A::~A() { }
