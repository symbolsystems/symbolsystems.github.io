DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"If an identifier is declared in an inner scope but is not distinct
from an identifier that already exists in an outer scope, then the inner-most
declaration will 'hide' the outer one. This may lead to developer confusion."

The rule checks if identifiers declared in local or function prototype scope
have the same name as an identifier declared in a global or namespace scope. 

See also: CODSTA-CPP-83, CODSTA-CPP-84, CODSTA-CPP-85, MISRA2004-5_1

BENEFITS

Hiding names of global identifiers can lead to errors and confusions.

DRAWBACKS

<PRE>

1.
The C standard defines four name spaces. Identifiers with the same name but from
different name spaces do not hide each other. This is not fully supported by
this rule which can result in false positives.

The 4 namespaces defined in C are:
- "labels":
  label names (disambiguated by the syntax of the label declaration and use)
- "tags":
  the tags of structures, unions, and enumerations (disambiguated by following
  any of the keywords: struct, union, or enum)
- "members":
  the members of structures or unions; each structure or union has a separate
  name space for its members (disambiguated by the type of the expression used
  to access the member via the . or -&gt; operator)
- "all other":
  all other identifiers, called ordinary identifiers (declared in ordinary
  declarators or as enumeration constants)

A false positive can be reported for identifiers from following namespaces:
- "tags" and "all other", for example:
    struct S {
        int i;
    };
    void foo() {
        int S;              /* False Positive reported */
    }
- "tags" and "labels", for example:
    struct S {
        int i;
    };
    void foo() {
      S:                    /* False Positive reported */
      return;
    }
- "labels" and "all other", for example:
    int my_label;
    void foo() {
        if (my_label) {
            my_label:       /* False Positive reported */
            return;
        }
    }

Note that MISRA C:2012 Rule 5.7 "A tag name shall be a unique identifier"
disallows first two of the above cases: "tag shall be unique across all name
spaces".


2.
Rule compares all characters in identifiers. This can cause false negatives
for very long identifiers.

According to C standard, only certain number of initial characters in
identifiers are guaranteed to be significant. For example in C90 standard, only
31 initial characters in an internal identifier are guaranteed to be
significant. This means that compiler can ignore non-significant characters.

For such compiler following global and local variable identifiers might be
identical and the local variable declaration will hide global variable
declaration:
    // same significant characters
    int var4567890123456789012345678901_abc;
    void foo() {
        // same significant characters
        int var4567890123456789012345678901_xyz; // No violation reported

        // This in fact might modify local variable:
        var4567890123456789012345678901_abc = 0;
    }

No violation will be reported in this case (false negative).

You can use MISRA2004-5_1 to detect identifiers longer than 31 characters.

    int foo_value1;    // OK - the name was changed

void foo2(){

void foo1(){
    int var1;      // OK - 'var1' does not hide global variable
}

int var1;

namespace N2{
