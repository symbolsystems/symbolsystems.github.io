DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>
This rule reports a violation when a local or temporary variable is destroyed and one of the
following occurs:
a) a pointer to the freed data is returned from a function, or
b) a variable still exists within the scope of the function that points to the freed data. 

A violation is reported if the variable that is referenced outside its scope has a freed pointer
field that points to the same location as a variable from a bigger scope.

<STRONG>
SECURITY RELEVANCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Referencing memory after it has been freed can cause a program to crash, use unexpected values, or
execute code.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>
The "Report unvalidated violations" parameter can result in more violations,
but possibly also more false positives, being reported. In this mode Flow 
Analysis will not check whether the path of the violation can be reached from
the beginning of the function. In some complicated cases, restricted analysis
depth may prevent Flow Analysis from completing the violation validation
procedure. If this happens, violation can be found only with this parameter 
turned on.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>
The use of previously-freed memory can have any number of adverse consequences, ranging from the
corruption of valid data to the execution of arbitrary code, depending on the instantiation and
timing of the flaw.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Here is an example that triggers a violation:

#include &lt;string&gt;

using namespace std;

const char* returnWrapped() {
    string s = "abc";
    s.append("def");
    return s.c_str(); // VIOLATION
}

struct A {
    int *p;
    A() {
        p = new int(8);
    }
    ~A() {
        delete (p);
    }
};

void foo() {
    int *p;
    {
        A a;
        p = a.p;
    } // VIOLATION
    // ...
}

REPAIR

<PRE>

#include &lt;string&gt;

using namespace std;

const char* returnNotWrapped(string&amp; s) {
    s = "abc";
    s.append("def");
    return s.c_str();
}

struct A {
    int *p;
    A() {
        p = new int(8);
    }
    ~A() {
        delete (p);
    }
};

void foo() {
    int *p;
    {
        A a;
        p = new int(8);
    }
    // ...
}
