DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Conversion of an integer into a pointer to void results in behaviour that is
implementation-defined.
Conversion of a pointer to void into an integer may produce a value that cannot
be represented in the chosen integer type resulting in undefined behaviour.
Conversion between any non-integer arithmetic type and pointer to void
is undefined." [MISRA C:2012 with Technical Corrigendum 2 Rule 11.6]

"The type char, the signed and unsigned integer types, and the enumerated 
types are collectively called integer types. Integer and floating types
are collectively called arithmetic types." [ISO/IEC 9899:1999]

This rule detects when an explicit cast is performed between a pointer to
void type and an arithmetic type.

EXCEPTIONS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"An integer constant expression with value 0 may be cast into pointer to void."
[MISRA C:2012 Rule 11.6]

The rule does not trigger when an integer constant expression with value 0 
is converted to a pointer to void type.

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule helps you prevent undefined and implementation-defined behaviors.

<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The following examples are reported by the rule.

void* getVoid ( void );
void f2 ( void* );
enum E { E1, E2 } e;

char foo1 ( void* vptr )
{
  signed int si = ( int ) vptr; // Violation
  ( short ) vptr;               // Violation
  return ( char ) getVoid ( );  // Violation
}

void* foo2 ( unsigned int ui )
{
  void* vptr = ( void* ) 0x001; // Violation
  ( void* ) ui;                 // Violation
  f2 ( ( void* ) ui );          // Violation
  return ( void* ) e;           // Violation
}

The following examples are not reported by the rule.

typedef void* VOID_PTR;

VOID_PTR foo ( int* int_p )
{
  //Exception: null pointer
  void* vptr = ( void* ) 0;       // OK

  // Not reported: conversion does not involve an arithmetic type
  int_p = ( int* ) vptr;          // OK

  // Not reported: implicit conversion
  return 1;                       // OK
}
