DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Subtraction of pointers only gives well-defined results if the two pointers
point (or at least behave as if they point) into the same array object."
[MISRA-C:2004]

This rule detects subtractions between expressions of pointer or array type
that do not point to the same array.

<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule does not check the flow, which may result in reporting false positive
or false negative violations, depending on how pointers are assigned on
different paths.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule allows you to avoid undefined behavior.

<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

void f1( int* p ) {
    int a1[3];
    int a2[4];
    int* p1 = a1;
    int* p2 = a2;
    int* p3 = 0;
    int ptrdiff;

    ptrdiff = p1 - p2;   // Violation
    ptrdiff = p1 - p3;   // Violation
    ptrdiff = p1 - p;    // Violation - it is not known where 'p' points
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

You can fix your code by only subtracting pointers that point to the same
object or array.

/* Examples of correct code */
void f1( ) {
    int a1[3];

    int* p1 = a1;
    int* p2 = &amp;a1[2];
    int ptrdiff;

    ptrdiff = p1 - p2;   // OK
}
