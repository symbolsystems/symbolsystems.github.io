DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Long functions have disadvantages:
"If a function is too long, it can be difficult to comprehend. 
Generally, it can be said that a function should not be longer 
than two pages, since that is about how much that can be comprehended 
at one time. 
If an error situation is discovered at the end of an extremely long function,
it may be difficult for the function to clean up after itself and 
to "undo" as much as possible before reporting the error to 
the calling function. "
