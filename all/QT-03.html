DESCRIPTION

<PRE>

Connecting a signal and a slot can be done by calling QObject::connect.
It's only possible to connect a signal to a slot or a signal to another signal.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Slots are to be considered observers, and are not possible to connect together
as there would be no source of signal to trigger the slots. However, you may
connect several slots to one signal. A slot cannot have a signal connected to
it, but a signal can have a slot connected to it; the direction of the
connection is important. You can connect as many signals as you want to a single
slot, and a signal can be connected to as many slots as you need. It is even 
possible to connect a signal directly to another signal. 
(This will emit the second signal immediately whenever the first is emitted.)

#include &lt;QtCore/QObject&gt;

class MyQObject: public QObject
{
    Q_OBJECT

public:
    MyQObject();

public slots:
    int sampleSlot(QString qStr, const MyQObject&amp; myQObjRef, int* i);

signals:
    void someSignal(QString qStr);

private:
    Q_DISABLE_COPY(MyQObject)
};

void myFunction(QString qStr)
{
    MyQObject obj1, obj2;
    QObject::connect(&amp;obj1,                                        // Violation
                     SLOT(sampleSlot(QString, const MyQObject&amp;, int*)),
                     &amp;obj2, SIGNAL(someSignal(QString)));
    QObject::connect(&amp;obj1,                                        // Violation
                     SLOT(sampleSlot(QString, const MyQObject&amp;, int*)),
                     &amp;obj2, SLOT(sampleSlot(QString, const MyQObject&amp;, int*)));
