Avoid wraparounds when performing arithmetic integer operations [CERT_C-INT08-d-3]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>
An integer overflow occurs when an integer value is incremented to a value that
is too large to store in the associated representation. When this occurs for
unsigned integers, the value can wrap to become a very small number.
For example: UINT_MAX + 1

Similarly, an integer underflow occurs when an integer value is decremented to
a value that is too small to store in the associated representation. When this
occurs for unsigned integers, the value can wrap to become a very large number.
For example: UINT_MIN - 1

While this may be intended behavior in circumstances that rely on
wrapping, it can have serious consequences if the wrap is unexpected.

This rule reports a violation when an overflow or underflow occurs in the
unsigned integer arithmetic operation.

SECURITY RELEVANCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Integer overflow can sometimes trigger buffer overflows that can
be used to execute arbitrary code, as well as lead to memory corruption. This
is usually outside the scope of a program's implicit security policy.

Unexpected integer overflow can be very dangerous if the result value is used in
a sensitive area, such as:
- Integer operands of any pointer arithmetic, including array indexing
- The assignment expression for the declaration of a variable length array
- The postfix expression preceding square brackets [] or the expression in
square brackets [] of a subscripted designation of an element of an array object
- Function arguments of type size_t or rsize_t (for example, an argument to a
memory allocation function)
- Loop conditions
- In security-critical code

<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>
'Violate on overflow' - when enabled, violations will be reported when an
overflow occurs, i.e. the result of the arithmetic operation is higher than the
upper boundary value for the given type.
This option is enabled by default.

'Violate on underflow' - when enabled, violations will be reported when an
underflow occurs, i.e. the result of the arithmetic operation is lower than
zero.
This option is enabled by default.

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>
This rule helps you prevent unexpected behavior (see SECURITY RELEVANCE).


</PRE>
<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

void example() {
    unsigned char c = 255;
    c += 1; // VIOLATION
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Use a wider type or validate ranges before the arithmetic operation:

void repair() {
    unsigned char c = 255;
    if (c &lt; 255) {
        c += 1; // NO VIOLATION
    }
}
