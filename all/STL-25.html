DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"A few algorithms can work with sorted or unsorted ranges, but they are most
useful when they operate on sorted ranges. A list of the algorithms that
require the data on which they operate to be sorted:
- binary_search, lower_bound, upper_bound, equal_range,
- set_union, set_intersection, set_difference, set_symmetric_difference, 
- merge, inplace_merge
- includes

Because the STL allows you to specify comparison functions to be used during
sorting, different ranges may be sorted in different ways. With so many
different ways to sort things, it's critical that you give the STL consistent
sorting related information to work with. If you pass a sorted range to an 
algorithm that also takes a comparison function, be sure that the comparison
function you pass behaves the same as the one you used to sort the range."
[Effective STL]

The rule reports a violation if an algorithm, working on data sorted in 
the different than default way, does not use comparison function.

BENEFITS

<PRE>

"The eleven algorithms that require sorted ranges do so in order to offer
greater efficiency than would otherwise be possible. As long as you remember
to pass them only sorted ranges, and as long as you make sure that the
comparison function used by the algorithms is consistent with the one used to
do the sorting, you'll revel in trouble-free search, set, and merge operations,
plus you'll find that unique and unique_copy eliminate all duplicate values,
as you almost certainly want them to."
