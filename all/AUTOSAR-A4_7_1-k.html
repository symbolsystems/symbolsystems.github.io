DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>
This rule detects when casting an integer value between signed and unsigned
types results in a value change.

A violation is reported when:
* The given value cannot be represented in the result type, and
* The width of the result type is greater than or equal to the width of the
source type

SINCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>
2023.1


</PRE>
<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>
A violation reported by this rule means that a reversible change of value
happened(the original value may be recovered via performing a reverse type
cast), not a permanent data loss.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
SECURITY RELEVANCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Converting an integer value to a type with a different sign may result in an
unexpected value change. This becomes security-critical when the value is used
to control looping, make a security decision, or determine the offset or size in
behaviors such as memory allocation, copying, concatenation, etc.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>
"Aggressive mode" - when enabled, violations will also be reported when the
value being cast is -1.
This option is disabled by default.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
EXCEPTIONS
</STRONG>
<PRE>
By default, violations are not reported when the value being cast is -1.
See also the "Aggressive mode" parameter.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>
This rule helps you prevent unexpected value changes.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

void example() {
    unsigned char c = 200;
    signed char d = c; // VIOLATION
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Validate ranges before integer type conversion:

void repair() {
    unsigned char c = 200;
    if ( c &gt;= -128 &amp;&amp;  &lt;= 127){
        signed char d = c; // NO VIOLATION
    }
}
