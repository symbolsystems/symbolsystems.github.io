Conversions shall not be performed between a pointer to an incomplete type and any other type [MISRAC2012-RULE_11_2-a-2]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"A pointer to an incomplete type shall not be converted into another type.
A conversion shall not be made into a pointer to incomplete type. Although
a pointer to void is also a pointer to an incomplete type, this rule does
not apply to pointers to void." [MISRA C:2012 Rule 11.2]

"Pointers to an incomplete type are sometimes used to hide the representation
of an object. Converting a pointer to an incomplete type into a pointer
to object would break this encapsulation." [MISRA C:2012 Rule 11.2]

This rule reports a violation if a pointer to an incomplete type is converted
(explicit or implicit) into or from a pointer to any other type. An incomplete
type is one that describes an object, but lacks information needed to determine
its size.

The implicit conversion of a pointer is detected in the following cases:

- assignment expression
- initialization (only simple variables and arrays)
- passing argument to function call
- returning value from function

EXCEPTIONS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"A null pointer constant may be converted into a pointer to an incomplete type."
According to the C standard, an integer constant expression with the value 0,
or such an expression cast to type void *, is called a null pointer constant.

"A pointer to an incomplete type may be converted into void." 
[MISRA C:2012 Rule 11.2]

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule prevents undefined behaviours.

"Conversion into or from a pointer to an incomplete type may result in a pointer
that is not correctly aligned, resulting in undefined behaviour.
Conversion of a pointer to an incomplete type into or from a floating type
always results in undefined behaviour." [MISRA C:2012 Rule 11.2]
