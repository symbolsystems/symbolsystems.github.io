DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"The ISO standard requires internal identifiers to be distinct in the first 31
characters to guarantee code portability. This limitation shall not be exceeded,
even if the compiler supports it. This rule shall apply across all name spaces.
The ISO standard requires external identifiers to be distinct in the first 6
characters, regardless of case, to guarantee optimal portability.
However this limitation is particularly severe and is considered unnecessary.
The intent of this rule is to sanction a relaxation of the ISO requirement
to a degree commensurate with modern environments and it shall be confirmed
that 31 character/case significance is supported by the implementation."
[MISRA C:2004 Rule 5.1]

This rule detects when two external identifiers that are declared or defined
in the same translation unit have the same first 31 characters in their names.

The rule checks the names of the following identifiers:
- variables and functions with internal or external linkage
- structures, unions, typedefs, enumerations, and enumeration
  constants that are defined in a file scope

SINCE

2020.2



</PRE>
<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule compares identifiers across all name spaces.
The rule does not report identifiers with identical names.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule helps you improve code portability.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

extern void NG_4567890123456789012345678901_v1();
static void NG_4567890123456789012345678901_v2();       // Violation

int NA_4567890123456789012345678901_v1();
struct NA_4567890123456789012345678901_v1{ int m; };    // Violation



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

You can fix the code by modifying the names of identifiers.

extern void Fa_4567890123456789012345678901_v1();
static void Fb_4567890123456789012345678901_v2();       // OK

int Va_4567890123456789012345678901_v1();
struct Sa_4567890123456789012345678901_v1{ int m; };    // OK
