DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Comments are intended to provide a rationale for programming decisions and
information about the code as it evolves. They are not intended to be used for
indefinitely disabling unused sections of the code, which can make the code
more difficult to  read and understand. Use conditional compilation constructs
(e.g., #if or #ifdef) for code that is not intended to be compiled and add a
comment explaining the use of the construct. Use a source control system as a
means of reintroducing code that has been removed.

This rule applies to both // and /* ... */ styles of comment.

Improves code readability and maintainability.

DRAWBACKS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule can report false positives if the comment contains text similar
to the code. In the following comment, a violation will be reported because
it contains the text that is similar to the function call:

/*
 * The file contains functions(name1, name2); variables(name1, name2);
 */

Similarities between source code and comment text may prevent the violation
from being reported on comments containing code.

    }
