DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"There are some situations in C or C++ code where certain parts of expressions
may not be evaluated. If these sub-expressions contain side effects then those
side effects may or may not occur, depending on the values of other 
sub-expressions.

The operators which can lead to this problem are &amp;&amp;, || and ?:. In the case of
the ?: operator, either the second or third operands are evaluated but not both.
The ?: operator is specifically provided to choose between two sub-expressions, 
and is therefore less likely to lead to mistakes."

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Rule checks only two nested levels of function calls.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Rule prevents conditional evaluation of the second or third operand of ternary
operator that can easily cause problems if the developer relies on a side effect
occurring.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

int i;
int j;
int foo( ) {
    return (i &gt; j) ? j++ : i++; // Violation - developer expects 2nd and 3rd
                                // operand to be evaluated
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

int i;
int j;
int foo( ) {
    if (i &gt; j) {      // OK
        ++i;
        return j++;
    } else {
        ++j;
        return i++;
    }
}
