DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Each identifier that begins with an underscore is reserved
to the implementation for use as a name in the global namespace."
[ISO/IEC 14882:2017]

It is recommended to begin a user-defined literal suffix with
a single underscore. However, it should not be preceded by a space,
comment or another character, because this results in the creation
of a reserved identifier.

This rule detects when a user-defined literal suffix is not
directly preceded by the literal operator 'operator""'.
