DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Declaring virtual destructors in classes that have virtual functions causes
the compiler to call destructors for each class from which the object inherits.
If a class has virtual functions, has no virtual destructor, and class
destructor is called then the rule reports a violation message.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Prevents memory leaks in derived classes. A class that has virtual functions
is intended to be used as a base class, so it should have a virtual destructor
to guarantee that the destructor will be called when the derived object
is referenced through a pointer to the base class.
