DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Every switch statement shall have at least two switch-clauses.
A switch statement with a single path is redundant and may be indicative
of a programming error."

A switch-clause in this rule is defined as a group of 'case' and 'default'
labels followed by at least one statement.

REPAIR

void repair ( int i )
{
  /* The first switch was rewritten into an 'if' */
  if ( ( i == 0 ) || ( i == 1 ) )

    i = i + 1;

  /* The second switch has been modified to contain two switch-clauses */
  switch ( i )                        /* Compliant */

      /* A switch-clause */
