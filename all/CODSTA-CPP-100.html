Do not compare objects of a class that may contain padding bits with C standard library functions [CODSTA-CPP-100-3]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"The object representation of an object of type T is the sequence of N unsigned
char objects taken up by the object of type T, where N equals sizeof(T).
The value representation of an object is the set of bits that hold the value
of type T." [ISO/IEC 14882-2014]

"[C]lasses may have bit-field data members, padding inserted between data
members, a vtable to support virtual method dispatch, or data members declared
with different access privileges. For such types, accessing bits of the object
representation that are not part of the object's value representation may
result in undefined behavior depending on how those bits are accessed."
[CERT-CPP-EXP62]

This rule detects when a pointer to a class that may contain padding bits
is passed as an argument to the 'memcmp' and 'strcmp' standard library
functions.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule assumes that a class contains padding bits when:
-its size is greater than the size of all of its non-static member variables
-it contains a non-static member variable that is a bit-field
-it contains a non-static member variable of bool or enum type
-it has a base class of size greater than zero

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule helps you prevent undefined or abnormal program behavior.

EXAMPLE

#include &lt;cstring&gt;

struct S {
    char c;
    long l;
};

void foo(S &amp;s1, S &amp;s2) {
    std::memcmp(&amp;s1, &amp;s2, sizeof(S));        // Violation
}

#include &lt;cstring&gt;

struct S1 {

    long l2;

void foo1(S1 &amp;s11, S1 &amp;s12) {
    std::memcmp(&amp;s11, &amp;s12, sizeof(S1));     // OK

struct S2 {
    char c;
    long l;
    friend int operator==(const S2 &amp;al, const S2 &amp;ar) {
        return al.c == ar.c &amp;&amp; al.l == ar.l;
    }
};

void foo2(S2 &amp;s21, S2 &amp;s22) {
    s21 == s22;                              // OK
