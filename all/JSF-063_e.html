DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule reports a violation if there is space, tab, comment or new line
character between a unary operator "&amp;", "*", "+", "-" and its operand.

<STRONG>
SINCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

v9.4



</PRE>
<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule does not report violations on unary operators used inside preprocessor
directives.

The rule does not report a violation on "operator" construct (declaration and
explicit call), for example:
int operator + (const A&amp;); // no violation reported
int x = operator+ (a); // no violation reported



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule promotes continuity in the relationship between the operators
and the operands on which they act.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
DRAWBACKS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule can report incorrect violation if in the same line is a unary
operator and a character with the same representation as the unary operator, 
but with different meaning (e.g. '-' used both as binary and unary operator).

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

int * foo(int i) {
    int * p;
    i = + 10;           // Violation
    i = -  (10);        // Violation
                        // Violation in next line
    i = *
        p;
    i = i - * p;        // Violation
}

#define XXX(a) - a      // OK - no violation on macro
class A;
int operator + (const A&amp;); // OK - no violation on "operator" construct
void bar(A&amp; a) {
    int x = operator+ (a); // OK - no violation on "operator" construct
    x = + a;               // Violation
}

int * foo(int i) {
    int * p;
    i = +10;        // OK
    i = -(10);      // OK
    i = *p;         // OK
    i = i - *p;     // OK
    p = &amp;i;         // OK
}

#define XXX(a) -a   // OK
class A;
int operator+(const A&amp;);   // OK
void bar(A&amp; a) {
    int x = operator+(a);  // OK
    x = +a;                // OK
}
