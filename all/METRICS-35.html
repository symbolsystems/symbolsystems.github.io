DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule identifies methods that do not satisfy the user-defined requirement
for Essential Complexity.
An error is reported if a function have the Essential Complexity higher than 10.

The Essential Complexity metric quantifies the extent to which software is unstructured.

The metric is calculated according to the formula:
  EC = Number of unstructured decisions + 1
By decision we mean every occurrence of:
  - 'if', 'for', 'while', 'do-while', 'case'
  - conditional expression 'a?b:c' inside 'if', 'for', 'while', 'do-while' condition
  - logical operator '&amp;&amp;' and '||' inside 'if', 'for', 'while', 'do-while' condition
By unstructured decisions we mean conditional jumps into or out of other decisions, e.g. 
'goto' inside 'if' which is in turn inside 'switch', or
'return' inside 'while' which is in turn inside 'for'.
If a decision contains unstructured decision then it's a unstructured decision itself.

Rule does not consider exception handling ('catch') as a decision.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Structured programming avoids unmaintainable "spaghetti code" by restricting the usage 
of control structures to those that are easily analyzed and decomposed."

By comparing Essential Complexity with Cyclomatic Complexity it's possible to find
functions that are complicated but well structured, which means they can be refactored.

EXAMPLE

void Example(int x, int y)    /* Violation: Essential Complexity = 12  */
{
    for(;x || y;) {                                // +2
        switch (x*y) {
            case 1:                                // +1
                for(;x &amp;&amp; y &amp;&amp; x &lt; y;) {    // +3
                    while (--x &gt; 0) {          // +1
                        if (y &amp;&amp; x % y) {        // +2
                            return;
                        }
                    }
                    if (x &gt; y) {                     // +1
                        goto OUT;
                    }
                }
                break;
            case 2:                                  // +1
                do {
                    x++;
                } while (x &amp;&amp; y &amp;&amp; (x * y &lt; 100));
                break;
