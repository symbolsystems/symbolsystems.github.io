DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"The C language allows the programmer considerable freedom and will permit 
assignments between different arithmetic types to be performed automatically.
However, the use of these implicit conversions can lead to unintended results,
with the potential for loss of value, sign or precision. The use of stronger
typing, as enforced by the MISRA essential type model, reduces the likelihood
of these problems occurring." [MISRA C:2012 Rule 10.3]

This rule detects cases when the value of an expression is assigned to an
object with a narrower essential type. A violation is not reported if an
expression is converted to a different essential type category (such cases
are reported by the CODSTA-163_b rule).

The term "essential type" is defined by the MISRA C:2012 standard.

NOTES

<PRE>
"The following operations are covered by this rule:
- Assignment by means of one of the assignment operators;
- Passing an argument to a function, in which case the argument is copied as 
  if by assignment to the corresponding parameter;
- Returning an expression from a function, in which case the result is copied
  as if by assignment to an object with the function's return type;
- Using an expression to initialize all or part of an object, including a 
  compound literal in C99, in which case the expression is copied as if by 
  assignment to the destination;
- The conversion of the constant expression in a switch statementâ€™s case label
  to the promoted type of the controlling expression."
[MISRA C:2012 Rule 10.3, Appendix J]
