Member version of swap should never throw exceptions [STL-42-3]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"The only loose end is my admonition to have the member version of swap never
throw exceptions. That's because one of the most useful applications of swap
is to help classes (and class templates) offer the strong exception-safety
guarantee. (...) the technique is predicated on the assumption that the 
member version of swap never throws."
