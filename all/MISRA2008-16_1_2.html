DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"When the inclusion and exclusion of blocks of statements is controlled 
by a series of preprocessor directives, confusion can arise 
if all of the relevant directives do not occur within one file." 
This rule requires that the number of preprocessor directives #if/ifdef/ifndef 
matches the number of #endif directives in the file.

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Rule improves good code structure and prevents maintenance problems.
