DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Variables will not be introduced until they can be initialized with meaningful values.
Rule reports a violation message if:
- value assigned to local variable during initialization is not used (i.e. there is
  no variable usage after initialization statement and before new value assignment)
- local variable is prematurely declared and is only used in for loop

SINCE

v7.1

<STRONG>
NOTES

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Prevent clients from accessing variables without meaningful values.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

int f(int);

void fun_1(int x)
{
   int i;             // Violation: i is prematurely declared 
                      // (the intent is to use i in the for loop only)

   int max=0;         // Violation: max initialized with a dummy value

   max = f(x);
   for (i=0 ; i&lt;max ; ++i)
   {
   }
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

int f(int);

void fun_2(int x)
{

   int max = f(x);   // OK: max not introduced until meaningful
                     // value is available

   for(int i = 0; i &lt; max; i++) // OK
   {
   }
}
