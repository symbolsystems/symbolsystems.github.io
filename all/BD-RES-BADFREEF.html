DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>
This rule detects functions that were meant to free resources, but do not guarantee that the resource
is freed under all circumstances. The rule checks functions whose name matches the pattern
you designate (it is set to "*free*" by default). A violation is reported when a function deallocates
resources passed as parameters on some paths, but on some paths they are not deallocated. This
can imply that calling the closing function under certain conditions may result in a resource leak.

The "Names of functions to check (wildcard)" text field allows to define the name pattern for functions that are to be checked.
The default value is "*free*".

The "Case sensitive" checkbox allows you to specify the above parameter without regard to case sensivity.

The types of resources handled by this rule can be viewed and edited in test configuration section:

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Here is an example that will trigger a violation.

#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

void bad_free(void* p, int condition)
{
    if (condition) {
        free(p);
    }
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>
The following code will not trigger a violation:

#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

void good_free(void* p)
{
    if (p != 0) {
        free(p);
    }
}
