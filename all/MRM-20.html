DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Every class that allocates resources for its data members using 
the 'new' operator should define the destructor to release these resources.
This rule detects when a class without explicitly defined destructor contains
the 'new' operator that allocates the memory and assigns its address to the
non-local pointer variable.

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule helps to ensure that all allocated memory is being cleaned 
up properly.
