A conversion should not be performed between a pointer to object type and an integer type other than 'uintptr_t' or 'intptr_t' [CODSTA-127_b-4]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"An integer may be converted to any pointer type. The result is
implementation-defined, might not be correctly aligned, might not point to an
entity of the referenced type, and might be a trap representation.
Any pointer or array type may be converted to an integer type. The result is
implementation-defined. If the result cannot be represented in the integer type,
the behavior is undefined. The result need not be in the range of values of any
integer type." [ISO/IEC 9899:1999]

The rule detects when a conversion (explicit or implicit) is performed between
an integral type and a pointer to object type.

Implicit conversion of a pointer is detected in the following cases:
- using an assignment operator,
- using an expression to initialize all or part of an object,
- passing an argument to a function call,
- returning an expression from a function,
- using equality, relational and logical operators.

The rule checks only conversions to a pointer to object type. Conversions
to pointer to function, pointer to void and to pointer to incomplete types
are not reported.

<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule detects 'array of type' in the same way as 'pointer to type'.

"Except when it is the operand of the sizeof operator or the unary &amp; operator,
or is a string literal used to initialize an array, an expression that has type
'array of type' is converted to an expression with type 'pointer to type' that
points to the initial element of the array object and is not an lvalue."
[ISO/IEC 9899:1999]



</PRE>
<STRONG>
EXCEPTIONS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

1. A null pointer constant that has an integer type may be converted
   into a pointer to object.
2. The C99 types intptr_t and uintptr_t, declared in &lt;stdint.h&gt;,
   are respectively signed and unsigned integer types which are capable
   of representing pointer values. Explicit casts between pointer
   types and 'intptr_t' and 'uintptr_t' types are allowed by this rule.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule helps you prevent undefined and implementation-defined behaviors.
