DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Conversion of a pointer to void into a pointer to object may result
in a pointer that is not correctly aligned, resulting in undefined behaviour."
[MISRA C:2012 Rule 11.5]

The rule reports a violation if a conversion (explicit or implicit) from 
a pointer to void type to a pointer to object type is used.

Implicit conversion of pointer is detected by rule in the following cases:
- assignment expression
- initialization (only simple variables and arrays)
- passing argument to function call
- returning value from function

The rule checks only conversions to pointer to object type, so conversions
to pointer to function type and to pointer to incomplete type are not reported.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Conversion of a pointer to void into a pointer to object should be avoided
where possible but may be necessary, for example when dealing with memory 
allocation functions. If conversion from a pointer to object into a pointer
to void is used, care should be taken to ensure that any pointers produced
do not give rise to the undefined behaviour" [MISRA C:2012 Rule 11.5]



</PRE>
<STRONG>
EXCEPTIONS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"An integer constant expression with the value 0, or such an expression
cast to type void *, is called a null pointer constant." [ISO/IEC 9899:1999]
"A null pointer constant that has type pointer to void may be converted
into pointer to object." [MISRA C:2012 Rule 11.5]



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule prevents undefined behaviours.
