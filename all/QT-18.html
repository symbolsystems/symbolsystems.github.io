Non-const function should not be called on the Qt object [QT-18-3]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The violation is reported when the data is pulled out of the object through
a non-const function for use in a const expression. For example, the 
QList::at(int) is a const function, whereas operator[] (list_obj[i]) is a
non-const function. Since a non-const function is used the implicitly
shared class has no option but to detach its data from the shared data as it
doesn't know if the user will actually use the data reference to alter it;
like in

   list_obj[i] = 1234;    // Set new value
   list_obj.at(i) = 1234; // Not possible, const T &amp; at (int i) const

Note that this really depends on how clever the compiler is, as some compilers
can understand that you meant the 
    const T &amp; operator[] (int i) const
in some cases. But generally it is strongly suggested that developers don't
rely on this, since if the compiler does not understand this difference they
will have a potential huge speed loss with too many detachments of the implicit
data sharing. So, in the cases where the developer knows a const variable is
what he wants he should use the const-only function

BENEFITS

<PRE>

Qt has many implicitly shared classes. These classes share their data
(very little overhead), but will detach from one another, and do a deep copy
(heavy, a "normal" copy and update of internal structures) when a non-const
function is called on the object.

EXAMPLE

<PRE>

#include &lt;QtCore/QList&gt;

// Using the non-const operator[](int) function
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    QList&lt;int&gt; list_obj;
    list_obj &lt;&lt; 10 &lt;&lt; 100 &lt;&lt; 1000;
    
    QList&lt;int&gt; copy = list_obj; // Create a shared copy
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; list_obj.size(); ++i)
        printf("Index %d: %d\n", i, list_obj[i]); // Violation, detaches
    
    return 0;
}

    list_obj[1] = 20;                                // OK  
    
    QList&lt;int&gt; copy = list_obj; // Create a shared copy
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; list_obj.size(); ++i)
        printf("Index %d: %d\n", i, list_obj.at(i)); // OK
    
    return 0;
