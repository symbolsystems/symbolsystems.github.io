DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Non-static data members declared in an aggregate class can be initialized
using either default member initialization or aggregate initialization
when declaring an object.

This rule detects when not all non-static data members are initialized
when declaring an object of aggregate type.

<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

An aggregate is a class or struct with
  - no user-provided, explicit, or inherited constructors, and
  - no private or protected non-static data members, and
  - no virtual functions, and
  - no virtual, private, or protected base classes



</PRE>
<STRONG>
EXCEPTIONS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule does not apply to data members whose type has a constructor.
This rule does not apply to objects of the 'va_list' type.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule helps you reduce the risk of an invalid state existing after
successful construction.

EXAMPLE

struct S1

    int m2;
    int m3 = 0;

    S1 s;              // Violation
}

struct S2
