Call delete on pointer members in destructors [JSF-079_b-2]
</STRONG>
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>
DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Classes performing dynamic memory allocation will use 'new'
in the constructor(s) to allocate the memory and will later
use 'delete' in the destructor to free up the memory. 
Failing to delete the pointer in the destructor often exhibits no obvious
external symptoms. Instead, it manifests itself as a subtle memory leak"
This rule reports a violation if it finds a pointer member allocated by 'new'
by any member function, that has no corresponding 'delete' in the destructor.
See also: MRM-42



</PRE>
<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Pointer member can be deleted inside function called from destructor.
The rule checks two nested levels of function's calls.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Rule prevents memory leaks now and as the code evolves in the future.

EXAMPLE

<PRE>

class A
{
public:
    A( );
    ~A( );
    void init();
private:
    int* ptr1;  // Violation
    int* ptr2;  // Violation
    int* ptr3;  // Violation
    int* ptr4;  // OK - null pointer
};

A::A() : ptr1(new int), ptr4(0){
	ptr3 = new int;
	init();
}

void A::init(){
	ptr2 = new int;
}

A::~A(){
	// any delete
}
