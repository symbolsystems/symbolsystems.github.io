DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"No function should be longer than what can be printed on a single sheet
of paper in a standard reference format with one line per statement
and one line per declaration. Typically, this means no more than about
60 lines of code per function." [The Power of Ten]

The rule counts lines containing source code between opening and closing
braces of function bodies.

"Each function should be a logical unit in the code that is understandable
and verifiable as a unit. It is much harder to understand a logical unit that
spans multiple screens on a computer display or multiple pages when printed.
Excessively long functions are often a sign of poorly structured code."
[The Power of Ten]

EXAMPLE

int foo( int x )     // Violation
{   // this line is not counted
    int i = 0;      // line 1
    if(x &lt; i)       // line 2
    {               // line 3
        x = i + 2;  // line 4
    }               // line 5
    
    // ...
    // more than 60 lines of constants, declarations, expressions, 
    // statements, types
    // ...
    return x;       // line 61
}   // this line is not counted
