DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"If a macro is defined but not used, then it is unclear to a reviewer
if the macro is redundant or it has been left unused by mistake."
[MISRA C:2012 with Technical Corrigendum 2 Rule 2.5]

This rule detects when a source file contains a definition of a macro
that is not used.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
SINCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

v9.6



</PRE>
<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule does not report:
- macro definitions in header files.
- macro definitions followed by the #include directive (because the macros may
  be used in the included files).

  #define M1 10       // Not reported - the macro may be used in file.h
  #include "file.h"



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule helps you improve code readability and efficiency.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
DRAWBACKS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule reports a false positive if a macro is only used in a definition
of another macro that has been defined earlier.

   #define M2 M1+1
   #define M1 10    // A false positive is reported
   void foo() {
       int i = M2;
   }

This rule does not trigger if an identifier with the same name as a macro is
used after this macro has been undefined.

   #define M1 10  // Not reported although the macro is not used
   #undef M1
   int M1;



</PRE>
<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

#define M1 10           // Violation
void foo( void ) {
    /* M1 is not used */
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

#define COND(x) x       // OK

#ifdef COND
  #define M1 10         // OK
#endif

void foo( void ) {
    int i = M1;
}
