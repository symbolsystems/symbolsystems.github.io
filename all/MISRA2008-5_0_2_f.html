DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"In addition to the use of parentheses to override default operator precedence,
parentheses should also be used to emphasise it. It is easy to make a mistake
with the rather complicated precedence rules of C, and this approach helps to
avoid such errors, and helps to make the code easier to read. However, do not
add too many parentheses so as to clutter the code and make it unreadable."
If parentheses are nested too deeply then you may hit a translation limit but
if this happens the expression is probably too complicated anyway and should be
split. The rule checks the number of nested parentheses - if the nesting level
exceeds 10 rule reports a violation message.


Note:

Nested parentheses level is set on 10 but can be changed. To change the
default level of the nested parentheses modify the main "Count" expression
of the rule (Collector A) from "$$ &gt; 9" to "$$ &gt; N" using desired threshold
value for N. Rule's header should be also changed accordingly.

void foo( )
{
   int a, b,c,d;
   a=(((((((((((b+1)+1)+c)*d)/2)+1)*b)+c)*d)+8)/(b+d))+3; // Violation
}

void foo( )
{
    int a, b,c,d;
    int h;
    h = (((((((((b+1)+1)+c)*d)/2)+1)*b)+c)*d)+8;   // OK
    a =(h*(b+d))+3;                                // OK
