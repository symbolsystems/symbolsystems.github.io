DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule reports a violation if "/*" is embedded in "//" comment.

MISRA C:2012 standard says:
   If a C-style comment starting sequence occurs within a // comment, it is
   probably because a region of code has been commented-out using //.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

MISRA C:2012 standard does not allow commenting out sections of code:
   Where it is required for sections of source code not to be compiled then
   this should be achieved by use of conditional compilation (e.g. #if or
   #ifdef constructs with a comment). Using start and end comment markers for
   this purpose is dangerous because C does not support nested comments, and
   any comments already existing in the section of code would change the effect.

C99 added "//" comments.

To check other combinations of embedded comments see MISRA2004-2_3 and
COMMENT-11 rules.

BENEFITS

<PRE>

Detects possible cases of commented out sections of code

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

// /* Violation - C-style comment embedded in C++-style comment */
// some_code();

void foo ( int a, int b, int c )
{
  // Following code executes "a = b + c", but it would be "a = b" if there was
  // no "//" comments:
  a = b // /* Violation - C-style comment embedded in C++-style comment
  + c;
  // */
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

// Use conditional compilation to "comment out" sections of code
#if 0
/* OK */
some_code();
#endif

// Alternatively, you could also use C++-style comments if your compiler
// and coding standard allows:
// // OK
// some_code();

void foo ( int a, int b, int c )
{
  a = b; /* OK - comments not embedded
  + c
  */
}
