DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Shift and bitwise operations should only be performed on operands
of essentially unsigned type. The numeric value resulting from their
use on essentially signed types may be undefined or implementation-defined."
[MISRA C:2012 with Technical Corrigendum 2 Rule 10.1]

This rule detects when the following operands have essentially signed
or essentially enum type:
- the left hand operand of the following operators: &gt;&gt;, &lt;&lt;, &lt;&lt;=, &gt;&gt;=
- the left hand or the right hand operand of the following operators:
  ~, &amp;, |, ^, &amp;=, |=, ^=

This rule assumes that:
- the enumeration type defined as "essentially Boolean" type is not
  essentially enum type.
- the signed type defined as "essentially Boolean" type is not
  essentially signed type.

The term "essential type" is defined by the MISRA C:2012 standard, but tools
may also provide additional ways of identifying "essentially  Boolean" types.
See "Notes".

NOTES

<PRE>

The rule assumes that "essentially Boolean" type is defined as one of
the following:
  - _Bool type defined in C99 standard library 'stdbool'
  - the result of a relational, equality and logical operator
  - an enumeration type whose name begins with 'bool' (case insensitive)
    or contains 'boolean' (case insensitive) and contains exactly 2 enumeration
    constants
  - typedef whose name begins with 'bool' (case insensitive)
    or contains 'boolean' (case insensitive) to:
    -- a char type defined explicitly as signed or unsigned
    -- a short or int type
    -- an enumeration type which contains exactly 2 enumeration constants

Enumeration constants have "essentially Boolean" type if they are defined
inside "essentially Boolean" types.

This rule helps you prevent developer confusion and undefined
or implementation-defined behaviors.

EXAMPLE

typedef enum { EN1, EN2 } TE1;   // Essentially enum type
void foo( void )
{
    signed char sc;
    signed int si;
    TE1 te1;

    te1 &gt;&gt; 10u;        // Violation
    ~(sc + 1);         // Violation
    si | 10;           // Violation x 2
}

void foo( void )
{
    unsigned char uc;
    unsigned int ui;
    unsigned int *pui;

    //Examples of correct code
    ui &gt;&gt; 10u;        // OK
    ~(uc + 1u);       // OK
    *pui | 10u;       // OK
