DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Streams and file I/O have a large number of unspecified, 
undefined and implementation-defined behaviours associated with them.
It is assumed that they will not normally be needed in production 
code in embedded systems.
If any of the features of stdio.h need to be used in production code, 
then the issues associated with the feature need to be understood."

This rule recognizes following #include directives:
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    #include &lt;cstdio&gt;

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

1. The only recognized form of #include directive is the form with the '&lt; &gt;'
delimiters. Please see Example section.

2. This rule cross-checks original source files (#include directives) and
preprocessed output (#line's). A violation is reported only if the stdio header
is actually included in current translation unit (a #line for stdio.h or cstdio
file is present).

If the stdio header is actually included in current translation unit,
a violation is reported on all #include directives, even if they are 
conditionally compiled. For example:
   /* header.h: */
   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;    /* Violation reported */
   /* source.c: */
   #include "header.h"
   #if 0
     /* A violation is reported on following #include directive because in 
      * current translation unit the stdio file is included somewhere    
      */
     #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;  /* Violation reported */
   #endif

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Prevents form problems associated with a large number of unspecified,
undefined and implementation-defined behaviour associated 
with streams and file I/O.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;  /* Violation */
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;   /* Violation */

/* #include directives which use quotes as delimiters are not recognized: */
#include "stdio.h"  /* OK - "stdio.h" not recognized */
#include "cstdio"   /* OK - "cstdio" not recognized */

/* #include direcives which use macro to specify header are not recognized: */
#define HEADER &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include HEADER     /* OK - macros not recognized */



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Do not use stdio library.
