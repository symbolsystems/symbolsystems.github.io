A full expression containing an increment (++) or decrement (--) operator should have no other potential side effects [CODSTA-123-4]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"The use of increment and decrement operators in combination
with other operators is not recommended because:
  - It can significantly impair the readability of the code;
  - It introduces additional side effects into a statement
    with the potential for undefined behaviour
It is clearer to use these operations in isolation from any
other operators." [MISRA C:2012]

"Accessing a volatile object, modifying an object, modifying
a file, or calling a function that does any of those operations
are all side effects, which are changes in the state of the
execution environment." [ISO/IEC 9899:1999]

The rule reports a violation if in a full expression ++ or -- operators
are used and at least one more other operation with side effect is present.
The rule assumes that each function call (implicit or explicit) causes
a side effect.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"A function call is considered to be a side effect for the purposes of this
rule. All sub-expressions of the full expression are treated as if they were
evaluated for the purposes of this rule, even if specified as not being
evaluated by The Standard." [MISRA C:2012]

In C++ code the rule does not report violations on calls of operator++
and operator-- functions.

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule prevents undefined behaviours and improves readability of code.

EXAMPLE

int fooint(int);

void foo(){
    int a, b, c;
    a = ++b + c--;             /* Violation */
    
    if (a++ &gt; fooint(2))       /* Violation */
    {
        //...
    }
    
    c = fooint(--b);           /* Violation */
