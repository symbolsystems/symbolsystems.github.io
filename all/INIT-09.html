Initialize static class members [INIT-09-1]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

All static member variables should be explicitly initialized.

Static members variables will be initialized by compiler, but it is considered
good practice to initialize all variables, not just automatic/stack variables,
to an initial value for purposes of clarity and bringing focused attention to
the initialization of each variable.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule will report a violation only if in current translation unit there is
an out of class definition (namespace scope definition). For example:
  class A {
    static int a;       // Not checked - no out-of-class definition
  };                    // in current translation unit

BENEFITS

<PRE>

Improves clarity of the code and brings focused attention to the
initialization of each variable.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

class A {
  static int a; // Not checked - no out-of-class definition
  static int b; // Checked - reported on out-of-class definition
};
int A::b;       // Violation - b not initialized



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

class A {
  static int b; // OK - initialized
};
int A::b = 0;   // OK - initialized
