DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The number of accessor and mutator functions should be minimized
to number of member variables. Rule reports a violation message
if number of setter methods or number of getter methods exceeds
number of member variables.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
SINCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

v7.1



</PRE>
<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Rule assumes that setter/getter (mutator/accessor) methods are methods
with names starting from get/Get or set/Set prefix and followed by
underscoring or capitalized letter.

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Numerous accessors and mutators may indicate that a class simply serves
to aggregate a collection of data rather than to embody an abstraction
with a well-defined state or invariant. In this case, a struct with
public data may be a better alternative.

EXAMPLE

class Sample // Violation
{
 private:
	int m_var;
 public:
    int get_m_var();
    void set_m_var();
    void set_m_var(int a);
};

class Sample // OK
{
 private:
	int m_var;
 public:
    int get_m_var();
    void set_m_var(int a = 0);
};
