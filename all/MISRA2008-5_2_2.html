DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Since the virtualness of inheritance is not a property of a base class,
the layout of a derived class object, referenced through a virtual base
pointer, is unknown at compile time."
"Casting from a virtual base to a derived class, using any means
other than dynamic_cast has undefined behaviour.
The behaviour for dynamic_cast is defined."
