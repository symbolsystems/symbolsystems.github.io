DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Multiple inheritance is more complex than single inheritance. It can lead to
new ambiguity issues and to the need for virtual inheritance. Any time you
have an inheritance hierarchy with more than one path between a base class 
and a derived class , you must confront the question of whether you want the
data members in the base class to be replicated for each of the paths."

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Multiple inheritance just means inheriting from more than one base class, but
it is not uncommon for MI to be found in hierarchies that have higher-level
base classes, too. That can lead to what is sometimes known as the "deadly MI
diamond". (..) "
