BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule helps you improve the readability of the code and avoid mistakes.

"The C language has a relatively large number of operators and their relative
precedences are not intuitive. This can lead less experienced programmers
to make mistakes. Using parentheses to make operator precedence explicit
removes the possibility that the programmer's expectations are incorrect.
It also makes the original programmer's intention clear to reviewers
or maintainers of the code." [MISRA C:2012]
