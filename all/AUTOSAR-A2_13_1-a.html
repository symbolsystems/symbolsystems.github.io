DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"The use of an undefined escape sequence leads to undefined behavior.
The defined escape sequences (ISO/IEC 14882:2014) are: \', \", \?, \\, \a, \b,
\f, \n, \r, \t, \v, \&lt;Octal Number&gt;, \x&lt;Hexadecimal Number&gt;." [AUTOSAR A2-13-1]

The rule detects when a character constant or a string constant contains the
'\' character that is not used either to define an escape sequence or to create
a universal character name.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Universal-character-names (\u hex-quad and \U hex-quad hex-quad) are also
allowed in character and string literals" [AUTOSAR A2-13-1]

This rule allows every use of '\' before 'u' or 'U' and does not check
if the value of the universal character name is correct.

The rule does not detect '\' characters in raw strings. In raw strings any
escape sequences are not processed.

The rule does not detect '\' characters used in #include directives.
These characters should not be used in any case in #include directives
and are disallowed by another rule.

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule helps you prevent undefined behavior.

EXAMPLE

void f1( char c, const char* s )
{
    c = '\k';           // Violation
    s = "dir1\dir2";    // Violation
    s = " \ unknown";   // Violation
}

/* Examples of correct code */
void f1( char c, const char* s )
{
    c = '\t';           // OK
    s = "name \n";      // OK
    s = "\u1234";       // OK
    s = R"(abc \def)";  // OK
