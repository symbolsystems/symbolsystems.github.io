DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"The right hand operand of a shift operator should be of essentially unsigned 
type to ensure that undefined behaviour does not result from a negative shift."
[MISRA C:2012 Rule 10.1]

This rule detects cases when the right hand operand of a bitwise shift
operator (&lt;&lt;, &gt;&gt;, &lt;&lt;=, &gt;&gt;=) has essentially signed or essentially enum type.

This rule assumes that the enumeration type defined as "essentially Boolean"
type is not essentially enum type.

This rule assumes that the signed type defined as "essentially Boolean" type
is not essentially signed type.

The term "essential type" is defined by the MISRA C:2012 standard, 
but tools may also provide additional ways of identifying "essentially 
Boolean" types.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule assumes that "essentially Boolean" type is defined as one of
the following:
  - _Bool type defined in C99 standard library 'stdbool'
  - the result of a relational, equality and logical operator
  - an enumeration type whose name begins with 'bool' (case insensitive)
    or contains 'boolean' (case insensitive) and contains exactly 2 enumeration
    constants
  - typedef whose name begins with 'bool' (case insensitive)
    or contains 'boolean' (case insensitive) to:
    -- a char type defined explicitly as signed or unsigned
    -- a short or int type
    -- an enumeration type which contains exactly 2 enumeration constants

Enumeration constants have "essentially Boolean" type if they are defined
inside "essentially Boolean" types.

EXCEPTIONS

<PRE>

"A non-negative integer constant expression of essentially signed type
may be used as the right hand operand to a bitwise shift operator."
[MISRA C:2012 Rule 10.1]

This rule does not report a violation if an integer constant expression
of essentially signed type is used as the right hand operand of a bitwise
shift operator. For complex expressions, the rule does not check if the
value of a constant expression is positive or negative.

void foo(int i) {
    i &lt;&lt; 1;        /* OK */
    i &lt;&lt; -1;       /* Violation */
    i &lt;&lt; 1+2;      /* Not reported */
    i &lt;&lt; 1-2;      /* Not reported */
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule prevents undefined behaviours.

signed int ret_int(void);

    c1 &gt;&gt; c2;                /* Violation */
    i1 &lt;&lt;= (c1 + c2);        /* Violation */
 
    i1 &gt;&gt;= ret_int();        /* Violation */
