DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Member functions should be contained in classes, not structs, because classes 
support both multiple instances and encapsulation. Structs are also often 
entirely public: whereas the default access level for members and base classes 
of a class is private. This rule detects if you define structs that contain 
member functions.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Readability. It is generally expected that types with member functions 
are classes, and many programmers still think of structs in terms
of their original meaning in C.
