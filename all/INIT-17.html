DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"If all user-defined constructors of a class initialize data members with
constant values that are the same across all constructors, then data
members shall be initialized using NSDMI instead." [AUTOSAR A12-1-3]

This rule checks if data members in a class are intialized to the same
constant value in all user-defined constructors.

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule improves code readability and consistency with the C++ standard.
The rule also allows the compiler to generate functions that are more
efficient than user-defined constructors.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
DRAWBACKS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule does not support member variables being intialized to nothing and
member variables being initialized with numeric operators.

#include &lt;cstdint&gt;

class B2                 // Violation

    B2(int a) : x(0), y(0.0F), str("a") {}

private:
    std::int32_t x;
    float y;
    std::string str;
