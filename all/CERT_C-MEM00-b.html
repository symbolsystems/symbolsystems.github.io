DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule reports a violation if a class contains a pointer member to non-static
data allocated by 'new' that is not deallocated in destructor via 'delete'.
Violation is not reported if a class does not define any destructor. 
The 'delete' operator can be used directly in destructor or in function
directly called from destructor.

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule helps to ensure that all allocated memory is being cleaned
up properly.
