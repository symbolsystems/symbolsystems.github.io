The goto statement should not be used [MISRA2012-RULE-15_1-4]
</STRONG>

<STRONG>
DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Unconstrained use of goto can lead to programs that are unstructured
and extremely difficult to understand."

The rule reports a violation on each use of 'goto' statement.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"In some cases a total ban on goto requires the introduction of flags to ensure
correct control flow, and it is possible that these flags may themselves be less
transparent than the goto they replace."



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule prevents confusions and improves readability and maintainability.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

int foo( int a )
{
    if (a &lt; 0)
    {     
        goto end;       /* Violation */
    } 
    a = foo(a-1);
end:
    return a+1;
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

int foo( int a )
{
    /* Code was changed and does not use goto anymore */
    if (a &gt;= 0)
    {
        a = foo(a-1);
    }
    return a+1;
}
