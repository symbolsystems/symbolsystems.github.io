Use bitwise operators only on unsigned operands [CODSTA-63_b-3]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Bitwise operators should be used only with unsigned integer operands, as the
results of bitwise operations on signed integers are implementation-defined.
Bitwise operators include the complement operator ~, bitwise shift operators
&gt;&gt; and &lt;&lt;, bitwise AND operator &amp;, bitwise exclusive OR operator ^, bitwise
inclusive OR operator | and compound assignment operators &gt;&gt;=, &lt;&lt;=, &amp;=, ^=
and |=." [CERT C-INT13]

This rule detects when an operand of a bitwise operator does not have
an unsigned integer type.

EXCEPTIONS

<PRE>

1. "When used as bit flags, it is acceptable to use preprocessor macros
    or enumeration constants as arguments to the &amp; and | operators even
    if the value is not explicitly declared as unsigned." [CERT C-INT13]
    This rule assumes that bit flags are:
    - expressions containing the left-shift operator in the following
      form: '1 &lt;&lt; non-negative integer constant', or
    - bitwise operators whose operands are bit flags, or
    - enumeration constants initialized by bit flags
    For example:
    enum BitFlags {
        EB1 = 1 &lt;&lt; 1 | 1 &lt;&lt; 2,  // EB1 is a bit flag
        EB2 = 1 &lt;&lt; 1 &amp; 1 &lt;&lt; 2,  // EB2 is a bit flag
    };

2. "If the right-side operand to a shift operator is known at compile time,
   it is acceptable for the value to be represented with a signed type
   provided it is positive." [CERT C-INT13]

   The rule does not trigger when the right-hand operand of the right-shift
   operator is an integer constant expression of the signed type.
   These cases are checked by the BD-PB-BADSHIFT rule.
