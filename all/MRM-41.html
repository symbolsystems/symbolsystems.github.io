A copy constructor shall copy all data members and bases [MRM-41-2]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"A class may contain many data members as well as exist within an inheritance
hierarchy. Hence the copy constructor must copy all members, including those
in base classes."

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule does not report violations on variables of class/struct type.
If a copy constructor of base class is called then the rule assumes
that all variables from a base class are copied.
If in constructor is called default copy assignment operator,
then the rule assumes that all member variables are initialized.

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Ensure data members and bases are properly handled when an object is copied."

class Base
{
public:
    Base();
    Base (int x) : base_member (x) { }
    Base (const Base&amp; rhs) : base_member (rhs.base_member) {}
private:
   int base_member;
};

class Derived : public Base
{
public:
    Derived (int x, int y, int z) : Base (x),
    derived_member_1 (y),
    derived_member_2 (z) { }
		
    Derived(const Derived&amp; rhs)         // Violation
    {
    }
