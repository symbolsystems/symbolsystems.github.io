DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"A variable ought to be declared with the smallest possible scope to improve 
the readability of the code and so that variables are not unnecessarily 
allocated. When a variable that is declared at the beginning of a function
is used somewhere in the code, it is not easy to directly see the type
of the variable. 
In addition, there is a risk that such a variable is inadvertently hidden 
if a local variable, having the same name, is declared in an internal block.

Many local variables are only used in special cases which seldom occur. 
If a variable is declared at the outer level, memory will be allocated
even if it is not used. In addition, when variables are initialized
upon declaration, more efficient code is obtained than if values are assigned
when the variable is used."

BENEFITS

Rule prevents from making the program harder to understand and maintain.

    if (x &gt; 0){

int foo2(int x){

        a = 1;

int foo3(int x){

    int a = 0;       // OK - variable is used in the same block

    if (x &gt; 0){
        a = 1;
    } else {
        return x;
    }

    return a;
