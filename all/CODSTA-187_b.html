DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

An expression of the 'signed char' type used as an array index is converted
to the 'int' type because of integer promotions. After conversion, the character
data can be interpreted as negative values and may result in accessing memory
outside of the array.

This rule detects when an expression of the 'signed char' type is used
as an array index.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"This rule is applicable only in cases where the character data may contain
values that can be interpreted as negative numbers. For example, if the char
type is represented by a two's complement 8-bit value, any character value
greater than +127 is interpreted as a negative value." [CERT-STR34-C]



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule prevents conversions that may result in accessing memory outside
of an array.

EXAMPLE

void foo(char* ch_ptr)
{
    char array[100];
    array[*ch_ptr] = *ch_ptr;                     /* Violation */
}

REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

void foo(char* ch_ptr)
{
    char array[100];
    array[(unsigned char)*ch_ptr] = *ch_ptr;      /* OK */
}
