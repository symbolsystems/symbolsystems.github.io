DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"[W]hen the allocation function returns a value other than null, it must be
a pointer to a block of storage in which space for the object has been
reserved. The block of storage is assumed to be appropriately aligned
and of the requested size. The address of the created object will not
necessarily be the same as that of the block if the object is an array."
[ISO/IEC 14882-2014]

"Do not pass a pointer that is not suitably aligned for the object being
constructed to placement new. Doing so results in an object being constructed
at a misaligned location, which results in undefined behavior. Do not pass
a pointer that has insufficient storage capacity for the object being
constructed, including the overhead required for arrays. Doing so may result
in initialization of memory outside of the bounds of the object being
constructed, which results in undefined behavior." [CERT-CPP-MEM54]

This rule detects when the placement argument that is passed to an allocation
function (placement 'new') is one of the following:
- an address to insufficient storage capacity
- an array of insufficient or not suitably aligned storage capacities

BENEFITS

<PRE>

This rule helps you prevent undefined behavior, including a buffer overflow
and an abnormal termination.
