Avoid calls to memory-setting functions that can be optimized out by the compiler [CERT_C-MSC06-a-2]
</STRONG>
<BR><BR>
<STRONG>
DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>
This rule detects when the call to a memory-setting function may potentially
be removed from the resulting binary code by the optimizing compiler, because it constitutes
a dead store.

The rule recognizes the following functions as memory-setting functions:

&lt;string.h&gt;
    void * memset(void * out_buf, int, size_t)
    void * memcpy(void * out_buf, void *, size_t)

&lt;winnbase.h&gt; (Windows API)
    void ZeroMemory(PVOID  out_buf, SIZE_T)

To avoid a violation being reported, it is usually recommended to use the safe version of
a memory-setting function or to make sure the memory is accessed after is is set.

Examples of safe versions of memory-setting functions:

&lt;string.h&gt; (since C11, Annex K)
    errno_t memset_s(void * out_buf, rsize_t, int, rsize_t)
	
&lt;winbase.h&gt; (Windows API)
    PVOID SecureZeroMemory(PVOID out_buf, SIZE_T)

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Exact detection of all the possible situations when the call to a memory-setting function
may be removed by the optimizing compiler is not possible, therefore there may be
cases when the rule:
* reports a violation even if the call will not be removed by the compiler 
* does not report a violation even though the call will be removed by the compiler



</PRE>
<STRONG>
SECURITY RELEVANCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>
Memory-setting functions are often used to overwrite the contents of the memory
that contains sensitive or confidentional data. If the compiler removes the call
to memory-setting functions as a part of its optimization process, the data
remains in memory even after the buffer is freed/deallocated.
"If this data contains sensitive password information, then an attacker can read
the password and use the information to bypass protection mechanisms." [CWE-14]


</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>
This rule helps you avoid leakage of sensitive data.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

#include &lt;string.h&gt;

void example()
{
	char password[100];

	// [...] Calculate and use password

	// Attempt to zero memory
	memset(password, '\0', 100); // VIOLATION
}


</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

#include &lt;string.h&gt;

void repair()
{
	char password[100];

	// [...] Calculate and use password

	// Zero memory
	memset_s(password, '\0', 100); // NO VIOLATION
}
