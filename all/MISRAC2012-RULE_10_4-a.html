Both operands of an operator in which the usual arithmetic conversions are performed shall have the same essential type category [MISRAC2012-RULE_10_4-a-2]
</STRONG>

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"The C language allows the programmer considerable freedom and will permit
conversions between different arithmetic types to be performed automatically.
However, the use of these implicit conversions can lead to unintended results,
with the potential for loss of value, sign or precision."

"Both operands of an operator in which the usual arithmetic conversions
are performed shall have the same essential type category. This rule applies
to operators that are described in usual arithmetic conversions. This includes
all the binary operators, excluding the shift, logical &amp;&amp;, logical || and comma
operators. The increment and decrement operators are not covered by this rule."
[MISRA C:2012 Rule 10.4]

This rule detects cases when the operands of the following operators have
different essential types:
+(binary), -(binary), *, /, %, &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=, !=, ==, &amp;(binary), |, ^, +=, -=,
/=, *=, ^=, |=, &amp;=, %=

The term "essential type" is defined by the MISRA C:2012 standard,
but tools may also provide additional ways of identifying "essentially
Boolean" types.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule assumes that "essentially Boolean" type is defined as one of
the following:
  - _Bool type defined in C99 standard library 'stdbool'
  - the result of a relational, equality and logical operator
  - an enumeration type whose name begins with 'bool' (case insensitive)
    or contains 'boolean' (case insensitive) and contains exactly 2 enumeration
    constants
  - typedef whose name begins with 'bool' (case insensitive)
    or contains 'boolean' (case insensitive) to:
    -- a char type defined explicitly as signed or unsigned
    -- a short or int type
    -- an enumeration type which contains exactly 2 enumeration constants

Enumeration constants have "essentially Boolean" type if they are defined
inside "essentially Boolean" types.

Integer constants with values '0' and '1' are considered to be constants of
"essentially Boolean" type.

typedef enum {false, true}  bool;   /* essentially Boolean type */
void foo(void) {
    bool b;
    signed int i;
    if(b != 0);  /* OK */
    if(i != 0);  /* OK */
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
EXCEPTIONS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"The following are permitted to allow a common form of character manipulation
to be used:
1. The binary + and += operators may have one operand with essentially character
   type and the other operand with an essentially signed or essentially unsigned
   type;
2. The binary - and -= operators may have a left-hand operand with essentially
   character type and a right-hand operand with an essentially signed or
   essentially unsigned type.
3. The operators covered by this rule may have one operand with essentially
   real floating type and the other operand with essentially complex floating
   type. In the case of the conditional operator, this exception applies to the
   second and third operands."
[MISRA C:2012 Rule 10.4 with Amendment 3]



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"The use of stronger typing, as enforced by the MISRA essential type model,
allows implicit conversions to be restricted to those that should then produce
the answer expected by the developer." [MISRA C:2012 Rule 10.4]
