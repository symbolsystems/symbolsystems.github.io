DESCRIPTION

<PRE>

"A loop counter shall not have essentially floating type."
[MISRA C:2012 Rule 14.1]

"A loop counter is defined as an object, array element or member of 
a structure or union which satisfies the following:

1. It has a scalar type;

2. Its value varies monotonically on each iteration of a given instance of 
   a loop; and

3. It is involved in a decision to exit the loop." [MISRA C:2012 Section 8.14]

This rule detects cases when a floating point loop counter is used in a 'for'
loop.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule assumes that a loop counter is an object, an array element or a member
of a structure that is used in a condition and modified inside the third clause 
of a 'for' statement. 

The rule assumes that an object is modified if:
- it is used as the left hand operand of the assignment operators
- it is used as the operand of the increment or decrement operators
- it is passed to the function as a reference to a non-const object
- its address is passed to the function as a pointer to a non-const object

BENEFITS

<PRE>

"When using a floating-point loop counter, accumulation of rounding errors may
result in a mismatch between the expected and actual number of iterations. 
This can happen when a loop step that is not a power of the floating-point
radix is rounded to a value that can be represented." [MISRA C:2012 Rule 14.1]

"Even if a loop with a floating-point loop counter appears to behave correctly
on one implementation, it may give a different number of iterations on another
implementation." [MISRA C:2012 Rule 14.1]

void canModifyObject(double* pf);

void foo()
{
    float vf;
    for (vf = 0.0f; vf &lt; 1.0f; vf += 0.01f);       /* Violation */

    double vd = 10.0f;
    /* 'vd' can be modified in the function 'canModifyObject' */
    for(; vd &gt; 1.0f; canModifyObject( &amp;vd )) { }   /* Violation */

    float farr[] = { 0.1f, 0.2f, 0.3f };
    for(farr[0] = 0; farr[0] &lt; 1; farr[0]++);      /* Violation */
}

/* Do not use loop counters with essentially floating type */

/* Examples of correct code */
void foo()
{
    float f = 0.0f; 
    int counter;
    for (counter = 0;  counter &lt; 128; counter++)    /* OK */
