DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"No dependence shall be placed on operator precedence rules,
below arithmetic operators, in expressions. Parentheses should
be used to clarify operator precedence rules to enhance readability
and reduce mistakes. However, overuse of parentheses can clutter
an expression thereby reducing readability. Requiring parenthesis below
arithmetic operators strikes a reasonable balance between readability
and clutter."

Following operators have precedence lower than arithmetic operators:
- shifts  "&gt;&gt;", "&gt;&gt;"
- comparison "&lt;", "&lt;=", "&gt;", "&gt;=", "==", "!="
- bitwise "&amp;", "^", "|"
- logical "&amp;&amp;", "||"
- conditional "?:"
- assignment "=", "*=", "/=", "%=", "+=", "-=", "&lt;&lt;=", "&gt;&gt;=", "&amp;=", "|=", "^="
- throw "throw"
- comma ","

EXCEPTIONS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

1. Violation is no reported for identical operators. We believe in this case
there is no need for extra parenthesis. For example:
   a &amp; b &amp; c; // OK - no need to write (a &amp; b) &amp; c;

2. Violation is not reported for top expression in right hand side of
assignment operators. The assignment operators have almost the
lowest precedence level and we believe in this case there is no need
for extra parenthesis. For example
   a = b &amp; c; // OK - no need to write a = (b &amp; c);

BENEFITS

Rule improves readability and maintainability.

EXAMPLE

<PRE>

int bar(int);
int foo(int a, int b, int c)
{
    int x;
    // The expression is interpreted as a &gt;&gt; (1 + b)
    x = a &gt;&gt; 1 + b;     // Violation - "+" is operand of "&gt;&gt;" operator
    // The expression is interpreted as (a &amp; b) | c
    x = a &amp; b | c;      // Violation - "&amp;" is operand of "|" operator
    // The expression is interpreted as (x ^ b) || c
    if (x ^ b || c);    // Violation - "^" is operand of "||" operator
    // Interpreted as (x = a), (bar(a) ? b : (c == 10))
    return x = a, bar(a) ? b : c == 10; // Violation 3x:
        // "=" is the operand of "," operator
        // "?:" is the operand of "," operator
        // "==" is the third operand of "?:" operator

int bar(int);
int foo(int a, int b, int c)
{
    int x;
    // Review the code to check if the evaluation order is correct.
    // Clarify the order of operations by splitting more complicated
    // expressions into several simpler expression or by adding
    // parenthesis. For example:

    // Original expression: x = a &gt;&gt; 1 + b;
    x = a &gt;&gt; (1 + b);   // OK - order made clear by adding parenthesis
    x = (a &gt;&gt; 1) + b;   // OK - a different order was imposed

    x = (a &amp; b) | c;    // OK
    if ((x ^ b) || c);  // OK

    // Original expression: return x = a, bar(a) ? b : c == 10;
    // was simplified by splitting complicated expression into
    // two simpler expressions and using parenthesis
    x = a;
    return bar(a) ? b : (c == 10);  // OK
