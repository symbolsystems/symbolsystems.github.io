DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"An include file for a class should have a file name of the form &lt;class name&gt;
+ extension. Use uppercase and lowercase letters in the same way as in the
source code." [Ellemtel]

A class declaration should be placed in a header file that has the same name as
the class (apart from the file extension).

This rule detects when the name of a header file is different than name of
the class declared in that file.

The rule only checks header files that include one and only one declaration of
a class or structure of non-POD type.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule assumes that a header file is any file included with the #include
directive.

The rule ignores nested classes and structures.

A structure is of non-POD type if it has one of the following:
  + a user-declared constructor
  + a private or protected non-static data member
  + a base class
  + a virtual function
  + a non-static member of non-POD type (or an array of non-POD elements)
  + a non-static member of reference type
  + a user-declared copy assignment operator
  + a user-declared destructor

BENEFITS

"Since class names must generally be unique within a large context,
it is appropriate to utilize this characteristic when naming its
include file. This convention makes it easy to locate a class definition
using a file-based tool." [Ellemtel]

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

In the following example, the 'MyClass1' header file contains the declaration
of the 'MyClass' class.

// file.cpp
#include "MyClass1.h"

// MyClass1.h
class MyClass{           // Violation
    int i;
};



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

To fix the code, rename the header file or the class so that their names are
the same.

// file.cpp
#include "MyClass1.h"

// MyClass1.h
class MyClass1{         // OK
    int i;
};
