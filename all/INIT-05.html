DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

A reference should not be initialized to an object whose address can be
changed. For example, if a reference is initialized to an object that is
obtained by dereferencing a pointer and the object that this pointer points to
is deleted, the reference will refer to a non-existing object.

This rule detects when a reference is initialized to an object accessed by
dereferencing a pointer.

BENEFITS

This rule helps you prevent illegal access to the memory that has been freed.

int * bar();

void foo(char * a)
{
   int * ptr = new int(1);
   int &amp; rintptr1 = *ptr;                      // Violation
   int &amp; rintptr2 = ptr[0];                    // Violation
   int &amp; rintptr3 = *bar();                    // Violation
   char &amp; rcharptr = *a;                       // Violation
   if (ptr) delete ptr;
   // ...
}

/* Examples of correct code */ 
int &amp; bar();

void foo(char &amp; a)
{
   int val = 1;
   int &amp;rval1 = val;                           // OK
   int &amp;rval2 = bar();                         // OK
   char &amp;rchar = a;                            // OK
}
