DESCRIPTION

<PRE>

Unions shall not be used to access the sub-parts of larger data structure.

One mechanism in C for accessing the sub-parts of larger data structures
(e.g. the individual bits of an I/O port) is to overlay one data structure
on another using unions.
For example, a structure containing bit fields might be overlaid 
on an integer.
This is not a secure mechanism for achieving the desired aim, because it
assumes too much about the way in which the different data types are stored.

This rule triggers when an union has some bit-fields member variable,
when it includes other data structures which themselves include bit-fields,  
or finally when it has a member variable of type array of char where dimension
is sizeof of some type (see examples).

typedef union {  /* Violation */
    struct {
        unsigned int en      :1;
        unsigned int dly     :1;
        unsigned int tm_en   :1;
        unsigned int dta_inv :1;
        unsigned int clk_inv :1;
    } _bitfield; 
    unsigned long _int;
} REG_PTR;

union A { /* Violation */
    int field;
    int firstTwoBits :2;
};

typedef int* TYPE;

union B { /* Violation */
    TYPE t;
    char bytes[sizeof(TYPE)];
};
