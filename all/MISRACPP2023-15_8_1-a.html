DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule checks your code for aliasing in assignment operators. Not checking
for assignment to self in operator= can free resources that might be needed
during the process of allocating new resources.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Checking for assignment to self may also save you a lot of work that you
would otherwise have to do to implement assignments.
