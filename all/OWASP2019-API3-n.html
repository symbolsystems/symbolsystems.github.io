DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule detects code that uses system properties, or environment variables:
a violation is reported on each call of getenv()/putenv() functions from
stdlib.h header.

There are multiple issues and implementation defined behavior related to
environment variables:

- The string pointer returned by getenv() may be modified (overwritten) by
  subsequent calls to the getenv() or other environment modifying functions.
  The string shall not be modified by the program. If you keep using it without
  making a copy you may end up with invalid (dangling) pointer or a pointer to
  a different string then the one returned by the initial getenv() call. Even
  making copy immediately is not completely safe - there's a race window
  between getenv() call and copying the string.

- Depending on the platform the variables may either be or not be
  case-sensitive. The matching conditions are not well defined, for example
  "VAR=value" might be matched on some systems but not on others.

- Names of environment variables are not standard so depending on their
  presence or values or setting them might not give expected results.

- The functions for altering the environment are implementation defined,
  for example putenv() is not a standard C99 function. putenv() need not be
  reentrant (and therefore not required to be thread-safe)

- Attackers can often change the value of environment variables, so limited
  trust should be placed in their values.

- Certain variables expected to be present in the environment can cause
  insecure program behavior if they are missing or improperly set.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

By controlling use of environment variables in the applications, they are made 
more secure. Environment variables can be used as security holes. 
If a malicious user passes a specifically crafted string into a running program 
via an environment variable, a buffer overflow attack can be launched. 
On the other hand, if a program writes sensitive information 
(such as a password) into an environment variable with putenv, it can be 
captured and used to gain unauthorized privileges or access to sensitive data.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

void foo( void ) {
    char *envvar;
    envvar = getenv( "LIB" );                   // Violation
    putenv( "LIB=c:\\mylib;c:\\yourlib" );      // Violation
}

REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Review each use of getenv/putenv functions and if it is correct
suppress the violation.
