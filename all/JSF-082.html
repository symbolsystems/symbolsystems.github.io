DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule makes sure your assignment operator's return type is non-const
reference to it's class' type and that it returns a reference to its left-hand
argument, *this. Having operator= return a reference to *this protects you
from not knowing where the temporary gets destroyed and allows you to declare
the operator='s parameter as a reference to const, which is safer than just
declaring it to be a reference.

BENEFITS

Returning reference to *this in operator= functions protects you from not 
knowing where the temporary gets destroyed and allows you to declare 
the operator='s parameter as a reference to const, which is safer than just 
declaring it to be a reference.
