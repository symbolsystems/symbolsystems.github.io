DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"For C compatibility, it is possible in C++ for a name to refer
to both a type and object or a type and function. This can lead
to confusion." [MISRA C++:2008 Rule 2-10-6]

"A class name or enumeration name can be hidden by the name of an object, 
function, or enumerator declared in the same scope. If a class or enumeration
name and an object, function, or enumerator are declared in the same scope
(in any order) with the same name, the class or enumeration name is hidden
wherever the object, function, or enumerator name is visible." [ISO/IEC 14882]

The rule reports a violation if in the same local scope is declared a type
(class/struct/union or enumeration) and an object, a function or an enumeration
constant with the same name.

Identifiers are declared in the same local scope if they are declared in the
same block in a function body. Members of the anonymous union declared
in the block are detected as identifiers declared in this block.

The rule does not check neither function parameters (their scopes are not
the same as scopes of identifiers declared in a function's body) nor variables
declared in the for-init-statement and in the condition of if, while, for, 
and switch statements (their scopes are not the same as scopes of identifiers
declared in blocks following these statements).
