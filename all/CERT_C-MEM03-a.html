Sensitive data should be cleared before being deallocated [CERT_C-MEM03-a-3]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule detects when sensitive data is not cleared before deallocation.
The rule must be parameterized to define sensitive data; see PARAMETERS.

SINCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

2022.1


</PRE>
<STRONG>
SECURITY RELEVANCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"When sensitive data such as a password or an encryption key is not removed 
from memory, it could be exposed to an attacker using a "heap inspection" 
attack that reads the sensitive data using memory dumps or other methods".
[CWE-244]

<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The 'Clearing data functions' parameter allows you to specify
functions that can sanitize sensitive data.
Fill in the following columns to configure a function.
- 'Enabled' - enables or disables the clearing function. If disabled, the rule
    does not consider the data processed by the function to be cleared.
- 'Fully qualified type name or namespace (wildcard)' - specifies
    the fully qualified name of the type that declares the function. You can
    use "*" for a function declared in any type.
- 'Function name (wildcard)' - specifies the name of the function.
- '+ definitions in subclasses' - if enabled, the information configured in
    the current row applies to functions with the specified name that are
    defined in subclasses of the given class. Note that this applies to both
    instance and non-instance functions.
- 'Returns clear data' - if enabled, the function clears its return value.
- 'Cleared parameters' - specifies which function parameters are cleared by
    the function. List 1-based indexes of parameters separated by a comma or
    use "*" to specify that all function parameters are cleared.
By default, the following function is considered to clear the data it processes:
 - 'memset*'

The 'Deallocating functions' parameter allows you to specify deallocation functions. 
The rule triggers when sensitive data is passed as a parameter to one of the listed functions.
Fill in the following columns to configure additional deallocating functions.
- 'Enabled' - enables or disables the deallocating function. If disabled, the rule
    does not consider the function to be a deallocating function.
- 'Fully qualified type name or namespace (wildcard)' - specifies
    the fully qualified name of the type that declares the function. You can
    use "*" for a function declared in any type.
- 'Function name (wildcard)' - specifies the name of the function.
- "+ definitions in subclasses" - if enabled, the information configured in
    the current row applies to functions with the specified name that are
    defined in subclasses of the given class. Note that this applies to both
    instance and non-instance functions.
- 'Deallocated parameters' - specifies which function parameters are deallocated.
    List 1-based indexes of parameters separated by a comma
    or use "*" to specify that all function parameters should be checked.
By default, the rule checks the parameters of the following functions:
- the "free" function 
- the "realloc" function 

The 'Sensitive variables' parameter allows you to specify the names of
variables that the rule considers to be sensitive.
Fill in the following columns to configure a sensitive variable:
- 'Enabled' - enables or disables the sensitive variable. If disabled, the rule
    does not consider the variable to be sensitive.
- 'Fully qualified variable name (wildcard)' - specifies the fully qualified
    name of the variable. You can use "*" to specify that all variables are
    considered to be sensitive.
By default, the following variable names are considered to be sensitive:
- '*[Pp]assword*'
- '*[Pp]asswd*'
 
The 'Sensitive functions' parameter allows you to specify functions the rule
considers to be sensitive.
- 'Enabled' - enables or disables the sensitive function. If disabled, the rule
    does not consider the function to be a sensitive function.
- 'Fully qualified type name or namespace (wildcard)' - specifies the fully qualified name
    of the type that declares the function. You can use "*" for a function
    declared in any type.
- 'Function name (wildcard)' - specifies the name of the function.
- '+ definitions in subclasses' - if enabled, the information configured in
    the current row applies to functions with the specified name that are
    defined in subclasses of the given class. Note that this applies to both
    instance and non-instance functions.
- ''this' object is sensitive' - if enabled, the function makes the object it is
    called on sensitive.
- 'Returns sensitive data' - if enabled, the function makes its return value
    sensitive.
- 'Sensitive parameters' - specifies which function parameters are made
    sensitive by the function. List 1-based indexes of parameters separated by
    a comma or use "*" to specify that all function parameters are sensitive.
By default, the following function is considered to be sensitive:
- '*[Pp]assword*'

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule helps you prevent the exposure of sensitive data to potential
attackers.


</PRE>
<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

In the following example, the memory holding sensitive data (password) is
deallocated without clearing the data first.

#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

char* getPassword();

void test()
{
    char *password = getPassword();
     
    /* Process password... */

    free(password);   // VIOLATION
    password = NULL;
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The code can be fixed by clearing the password before the memory is deallocated.

#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

char* getPassword();

void test()
{
    char *password = getPassword();
     
    /* Process password... */

    /* Clear password */
    memset((volatile char*)password, '\0', strlen(password));

    free(password);   // NO VIOLATION
    password = NULL;
}
