DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Whenever you define a variable of a type with a constructor or destructor,
you incur the cost of construction when control reaches the variable's
definition, and you incur the cost of destruction when the variable goes out
of scope. There's a cost associated with unused variables, so you want to
avoid them whenever you can. You're probably thinking that you never define
unused variables, but you may need to think again. Consider the following
function:

std::string encryptPassword(const std::string&amp; password)
{
   using namespace std;
   string encrypted;
   if (password.length() &lt; MinimumPasswordLength) {
     throw logic_error("Password is too short");
   }
   //...  do whatever is necessary to place an
   return encrypted;
}

The object encrypted isn't completely unused in this function, 
but it's unused if an exception is thrown."
