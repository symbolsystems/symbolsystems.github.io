Signed and unsigned values shall not be mixed in arithmetic operations [CODSTA-100-3]
</STRONG>

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Mixing signed and unsigned values is error prone as it subjects operations
to numerous arithmetic conversion and integral promotion rules."
The rule reports a violation if one operand of arithmetic binary expression
is signed type and other is unsigned type.
 
The following binary arithmetic operators are checked:
  '+',  '-',  '*',  '/',  '%',  '^',  '&amp;',  '|', 
  '+=', '-=', '*=', '/=', '%=', '^=', '&amp;=', '|='

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

It is recommended to give a 'u' suffix to integer constants where it can be
used to avoid mixing signed and unsigned arithmetic in an expression.

The rule takes the type of expression according to C/C++ standard.
Due to integral promotion the type of expression containing only unsigned 
operands can be signed, so the rule reports violations on the code like this:

  (unsigned_short + unsigned_short) + unsigned_int;  // Violation

Violation is reported because the type of expression
(unsigned_short + unsigned_short) is signed int.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
EXCEPTIONS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The violation is not reported if at least one operand of expression
is constant expression (contains only literals, enumerations or
sizeof expressions).

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Complying with this rule leads to safer and more readable code.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

void foo1(signed int i, unsigned int ui) {
    i += ui;                  // Violation
}

void foo2(unsigned short us1, unsigned short us2, unsigned int ui1) {
    unsigned int ui2;
    ui2 = (us1 + us2) - ui1;  // Violation - The type of expression us1 + us2
                              // is 'signed int' due to integral promotion
}

// Example: no violation is reported if one operand is constant expression
void foo3(signed int i, unsigned int ui) {
    i = ui - 1;            // OK - RHS of '-' is arithmetic constant expression
    ui = (sizeof(i) + i);  // OK - LHS of '+' is arithmetic constant expression
}

REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

void foo1(signed int i, unsigned int ui) {
    // Review the code and see if it possible to change the types.
    // Cast only if you are sure the cast won't change the value.
    i += (int)ui;               // OK
}

void foo2(unsigned short us1, unsigned short us2, unsigned int ui1) {
    unsigned int ui2;
    unsigned int ui_tmp = us1 + us2;
    ui2 = ui_tmp - ui1;         // OK
}
