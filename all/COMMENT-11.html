DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule reports a violation if "//" is embedded in "/* ... */" comment.

A C-style comment begins with /* and continues until the first */ is
encountered.

MISRA C:2012 standard says:
   If a comment starting sequence // occurs within a /* comment,
   is it quite likely to be caused by a missing */ comment ending sequence.

<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

MISRA C:2012 standard suggests using conditional compilation (e.g. #if or
   #ifdef) instead of comments to "comment out" sections of code.

C99 added "//" comments.

To check other combinations of embedded comments see MISRA2004-2_3 and
COMMENT-12 rules.

This rule will ignore instances which are URI specifications, such as:
<A HREF="http://foo.com/,">http://foo.com/,</A> ftp://zork.com, telnet://quux, mailto://fred@flintstones.net

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Detects possible accidental ommision of "*/" end-comment marker.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

/* Violation - some comment, end-comment marker accidentally omitted

&lt;new page&gt;
// embedded comment suggests commented out code
Perform_Safety_Critical_Code();

/* another comment closes the first comment so there are no parse errors */



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

/* review the code and decide if end-comment marked should be added */

/* alternatively, if the decide the comment/code is correct, you could
   remove/mangle the embedded comment marker:

&lt;new page&gt;
embedded comment marker removed
Perform_Safety_Critical_Code();

end of comment */

/* the suggested way to "comment out" code is to use conditional compilation: */
#if 0
some_code();
#endif
