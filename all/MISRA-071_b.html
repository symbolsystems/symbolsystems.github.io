Functions shall always have visible prototype at the function call [MISRA-071_b-3]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Provided that a function call is made in the presence of a prototype,
a constraint ensures that the number of arguments matches the number
of parameters and that each argument can be assigned to its corresponding
parameter." [MISRA C:2012 Rule 17.3]

The rule requires that prototype (declaration or definition of function
that explicitly declares types of all parameters or uses explicit 'void'
if the function does not have parameters) must be declared before the
function is called.

This rule is enabled only for C language.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"The recommended method of implementing function prototypes for external
functions is to declare the function (i.e. give the function prototype)
in a header file, and then include the header file in all those code files
that need the prototype." [MISRA C:2004 Rule 8.1]

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"If a function is declared implicitly, a C90 compiler will assume that
the function has a return type of int. Since an implicit function declaration
does not provide a prototype, a compiler will have no information about
the number of function parameters and their types. Inappropriate type
conversions may result in passing the arguments and assigning the return
value, as well as other undefined behaviour." [MISRA C:2012 Rule 17.3]

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

/* file *.c */

void foo1(){}                     /* not a prototype */
void foo2(x, y);                  /* not a prototype */

void funCall(void){
  foo1();    /* Violation - call without prototype */
  foo2(1,2); /* Violation - call without prototype */
  foo3();    /* Violation - call without prototype */
  foo4();    /* Violation - prototype declared after function call */
}

void foo2(x, y) int x; int y; {}

void foo4(void);
void foo4(void) {}

REPAIR

<PRE>

/* file *.h */

void foo2(int x, int y); /* explicit types were added */
void foo3(void);         /* prototype was added to header */
void foo4(void);         /* prototype was moved to header */

/* file *.c */
#include "*.h"

void foo1(void){}        /* 'void' was added */

void funCall(void){
  foo1();      /* OK */
  foo2(1,2);   /* OK */
  foo3();      /* OK */
  foo4();      /* OK */
}

void foo2(x, y) int x; int y; {} 
void foo3(void) {}
void foo4(void) {}
