DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"The value of a complex expression of floating type may only be cast
to a narrower floating type." [MISRA-C:2004]

"A cast applied to the result of an expression does not change the type in which
the expression is evaluated, which may be contrary to developer expectations."
[MISRA C++:2008]

This rule detects when a complex expression of floating type is explicitly cast
to an integer type.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"The term 'complex expression' is defined to mean any expression that is not:
- a constant expression
- an lvalue (i.e. an object)
- the return value of a function" [MISRA-C:2004]

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Complex expressions are often a source of confusion and it is therefore
wise to be cautious. In order to comply with these rules, it may be necessary
to use a temporary variable and introduce an extra statement." [MISRA-C:2004]

void f1( ) {

    int s32a;

    s32a = (int)(f32a/f32b);   /* Violation */
}
