const member functions shall not return non-const pointers or references to class-data [MISRA2008-9_3_1-2]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"When an object is declared with const class type, only const member functions
can be invoked on that object. The common expectation of const member functions
is that the state of the object may not be modified when invoking the
functions. However, returning a non-const pointer or reference to class-data
from a const function allows a modification to the conceptual state of an
object."

<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Handle to class-data is:
- reference to member variable/member function
- pointer to member variable/member function
- pointer/reference to data allocated in constructor or deallocated in destructor
Static variables are not considered class-data.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Rule prevents exposing internal state of the object to clients, so they won't 
uncontrollably modify the state of the object. Enforces data encapsulation that 
is a cornerstone of Object Oriented programming. Improves code maintainability.
Helps const functions act const.
