DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"If data is declared to be const or constexpr then its value can not be changed
by mistake. Also, such declaration can offer the compiler optimization
opportunities." [AUTOSAR A7-1-1]

The rule detects immutable local variables declared without the 'const'
qualifier.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

For variables of pointer type the const qualifier should be applied to the
pointer, not to the pointed object.

The rule does not report violations on variables of array type.
The 'const' qualifier added in array declaration causes only that array
elements can not be changed.

The rule does not trigger on variables captured by reference by lambda
expressions.

This rule does not report on local variables in template functions.

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

It's safe, it's checked at compile time, and it's integrated
with C++'s type system. It also prevents future revisions
from unintentional changing the caller's data.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

int foo1(){
    int var1 = 0;             // Violation
    const int* var2 = 0;      // Violation - const is applied to the
                              // pointed object, not to the pointer
    return  1;
}

int foo2(){
    int var1 = 0;             // OK - var1 is modified
    const int* var2 = 0;      // OK - var2 is modified
    var2++;
    var1 = 1;
    return 1;
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

// Fixed violations - const added
int foo1(){
    const int var1 = 0;        // OK
    const int* const var2 = 0; // OK
    return  1;
}
