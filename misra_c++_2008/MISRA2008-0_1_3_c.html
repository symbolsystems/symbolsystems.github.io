Eliminate unused private member variables [MISRA2008-0_1_3_c-2]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Variables declared and never used in a project constitute noise and may
indicate that the wrong variable name has been used somewhere. Removing these
declarations reduces the possibility that they may later be used instead
of the correct variable." [MISRA C++:2008]

This rule detects private member variables that are declared but never used in
the code.

<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule does not recognize initialization of a member variable in
the constructor list to be a use of that variable.

This rule does not trigger if the private member variable is declared in
a class that meets one of the following conditions:
- It contains one or more functions that have non-accessible bodies (in
  the tested translation unit).
- It is a friend of a class that contains one or more functions that have
  non-accessible bodies (in the tested translation unit).
- It is a friend of a template class or a template function.

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule helps you improve code readability and efficiency, as well as prevent
problems that may be caused by confusing variable names.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

In the following example, the "m1", " m2", "m3", and "m4" variables are
declared, but never used (initialization in a constructor is not recognized to
be a use).

class A {
public:
    A();
    int foo(A a);
private:
    int m1; // Violation
    int m2; // Violation
    int m3; // Violation
    int m4; // Violation
};

A::A() : m1(0), m2(1), m3(2) {}

int A::foo(A a){}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

You can fix the code by either using or removing the declared variables. In
the fix below, the "m1", " m2", and "m3" variables are used, while the "m4"
variable is removed.

class A {
public:
    A();
    int foo(A a);
private:
    int m1; // OK
    int m2; // OK
    int m3; // OK
};

A::A() : m1(0), m2(1), m3(2) {}

int A::foo(A a){
    m1 = a.m2 + this-&gt;m3;
    return m1;
}
