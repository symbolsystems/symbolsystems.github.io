DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Be aware of trigraph and digraph character sequences and avoid them. It is
possible to avoid such sequences arising accidentally by using spaces."
[High Integrity C++]

This rule detects when digraphs are used in code. The rule assumes that
digraphs are the following two-character sequences: &lt;%, %&gt;, &lt;:, :&gt;, %:.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
SINCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

v7.1



</PRE>
<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule doesn't report digraphs in comments and strings.

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"In most modern environments there is no longer a need for trigraphs or
digraphs, and their use will either result in hard to diagnose compiler errors
or code that is difficult to maintain." [High Integrity C++]

This rule helps you improve code readability, maintainability, and portability.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

int tab &lt;: 2 :&gt; = &lt;%0,1%&gt;;                            // Violation

%:define FOO(a, b) a %:%: b                           // Violation



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

To fix the code, replace the digraphs with their one-character equivalents.

int tab[2] = {0,1};                                   // OK

#define FOO(a, b) a ## b                              // OK
