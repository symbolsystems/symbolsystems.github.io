DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"C performs many type conversions implicitly and silently,
so as to harmonize types within an expression before evaluating it.
Some of these conversions can result in loss of information. 
Such implicit conversions shall not be used, but explicit casts
should be used instead." [Misra C:1998 Rule 43]

The above applies also to the C++ standard.

This rule detects cases when the value of an expression of floating type
is assigned to an object with a narrower 'underlying type'.

The rule does not report a violation if a non-complex floating constant
is implicitly converted to a narrower floating type. These cases are reported
by the MISRA2004-10_2_d rule.

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The following operations are covered by this rule:
- Assignment by means of one of the assignment operators;
- Passing an argument to a function, in which case the argument is copied as 
  if by assignment to the corresponding parameter;
- Returning an expression from a function, in which case the result is copied
  as if by assignment to an object with the function's return type;
- Using an expression to initialize all or part of an object, including a 
  compound literal in C99, in which case the expression is copied as if by 
  assignment to the destination;
- The conversion of the constant expression in a switch statement's case label
  to the promoted type of the controlling expression.

"Explicit casts should normally only be used in the case where a conversion 
which could result in a loss of information is specifically required by the 
programmer. If the static checking of implicit conversions is overridden by
the use of explicit casts in this way, then the programmer should be aware
of the issues of truncation and lost of precision associated with the operation,
and should provide appropriate checking of values in the code."
[Misra C:1998 Rule 43]
