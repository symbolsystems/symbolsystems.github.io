DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"A for loop without exactly one loop-counter is simply a while loop.
If this is the desired behaviour, then a while loop is more appropriate."

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

A loop-counter is a loop-control-variable that is:
- Initialized in, or prior to, for-init-statement; and
- an operand to a relational operator in condition; and
- modified in expression.
A loop-control-variable is any variable occurring in for-init-statement,
condition or expression.

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
