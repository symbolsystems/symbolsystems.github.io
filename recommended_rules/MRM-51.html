DESCRIPTION

<PRE>

"If the dynamic type of the object to be deleted differs from its static type,
the behavior is undefined. This implies that an object cannot be deleted using
a pointer of type void* because there are no objects of type void"
[ISO/IEC 14882:1998]

Deleting a void pointer may cause a resource leak because the destructor won't
be called on the value it actually points to.

The rule reports a violation if the operand of the 'delete' operator
is a pointer to a void type.
