Local variables should not use the same names as member variables [CODSTA-44-1]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

If a local variable uses the same name as member variable, then it hides
this variable, what may lead to developer confusion.

The rule reports a violation if a local variable declared in a member
function uses the same name as member variable of current class
or as public/protected member variable of base class.
