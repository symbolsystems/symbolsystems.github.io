DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"In an expression, sub-expressions are evaluated at the precision appropriate
to the types of the operands. This may be less than the precision of the final
result. It is therefore possible to be misled into creating sub-expressions
which are evaluated at the wrong precision, which may result in values which
are not as the programmer intended." [MISRA C:1998]

"If an integer expression involving an operation is assigned to a larger
integer size, that integer expression should be evaluated in that larger
size by explicitly casting one of the operands." [CERT C: INT18-C]

If the result of integer multiplication, addition, subtraction,
or left-shift operation is converted to a wider integer type, 
then unexpected integer overflow is possible.

This rule reports a violation if the result of multiplication, addition,
subtraction or left-shift operation is explicitly cast from an integer
type to a wider integer type.

    ll = (long long)(i + j);              // Violation
    ll = (long long)(j - 1024);           // Violation
    ll = (long long)(i &lt;&lt; 8);             // Violation
    l = (long)(i * 10);         // Violation only if sizeof(long) &gt; sizeof(int)
