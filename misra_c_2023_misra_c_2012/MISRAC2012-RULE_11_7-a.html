DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule reports a violation if an explicit cast between a pointer to
"object type" and "non-integer arithmetic type" is used.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
SINCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

v9.5



</PRE>
<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule recognizes following types as pointers to "object type":
- pointer to class/struct/union which is not incomplete
- pointer to enum
- pointer to primitive type like bool, char, int, float, pointer etc
  (except for pointer to void)

This rule recognizes following as "non-integer arithmetic types":
- plain char
- named enum, or enum which is used in the definition of an object, function or
  a type
- results of logical and comparison operators (!, &amp;&amp;, ||, ==, !=, &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=)
- floating-point types



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Conversion of an boolean, character or enum type into a pointer to object may
result in a pointer that is not correctly aligned, resulting in undefined
behaviour.

Conversion of a pointer to object into a boolean, character or enum type may
produce a value that cannot be represented in the chosen integer type resulting
in undefined behavior.

Conversion of a pointer to object into or from an floating type results in
undefined behaviour." [MISRA C:2012 Rule 11.7]

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

/* Code examples which result in rule violation */

struct S {
  int x;
};
struct S * sp;  /* pointer to "object type" */

int *ptr_obj;   /* pointer to "object type" */

char c;         /* variable with "non-integer arithmetic type" */

enum E { EV };
enum { VV } e2; /* variable with "non-integer arithmetic types" */

void foo1 ( void )
{
  (char) sp;          /* Violation */
  (enum E) ptr_obj;   /* Violation */

  (struct S *) c;     /* Violation */
  (int *) EV;         /* Violation */
  (char *) e2;        /* Violation */

  (float *) (c &lt; 0);  /* Violation */
}

/* Examples of code which do not result in rule violation */

  (struct R *) sc;          /* Not reported - not plain char */
  (int *) EV;               /* Not reported - unnamed enum */
