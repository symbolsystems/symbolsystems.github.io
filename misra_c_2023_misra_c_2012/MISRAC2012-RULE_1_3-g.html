Don't write code that depends on the order of evaluation of function arguments [MISRAC2012-RULE_1_3-g-2]
</STRONG>
<BR><BR>

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The order of evaluation of function arguments is unspecified. This means that
if arguments contain side effects then the order in which side effects take
place is unspecified. A function call can give different results depending
on which of the function's arguments is evaluated first.
By side effect we understand accessing a volatile object, modifying an object
or calling a function that does any of those operations.

Rule checks calls of functions that have at least two arguments.
A violation is reported if
  * a volatile object is read or modified, or
  * a non-volatile object is modified
during evaluation of a function argument and the same (non-volatile or volatile)
or other (volatile) object is read or modified during evaluation of function's
other argument.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
EXCEPTIONS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Only one level of function calls is checked.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Rule prevents writing source code which might produce different results
between compilers.

EXAMPLE

<PRE>

void Transmogrify(int,int);
int Bump(int&amp; x) {return ++x;}
void foo()
{
    int count = 5;
    Transmogrify(Bump(count),Bump(count)); // Violation
    Transmogrify(count++,count);           // Violation
}

REPAIR

<PRE>

void Transmogrify(int,int);
int Bump(int&amp; x) {return ++x;}
void foo()
{
    int count = 5;
    int temp1 = Bump(count);
    Transmogrify(temp1,Bump(count)); // OK
    Transmogrify(count,count);       // OK
    count++;
}
