DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule detects when a 'const', 'volatile' or '_Atomic' qualification is
removed by a conversion from the type pointed to by a pointer.
Both implicit conversions and explicit casts are checked.

"Any attempt to remove the qualification associated with the addressed type
is a violation of the principle of type qualification." [MISRA-C:2012]

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"The presence of the _Atomic qualifier designates an atomic type. The size,
representation, and alignment of an atomic type need not be the same as those
of the corresponding unqualified type." [ISO/IEC 9899:2017]

This rule is enabled for C only - nothing will be reported on C++ files.

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule helps you prevent the issues listed below.

"Some of the problems that might arise if a qualifier is removed from the
addressed object are:
* Removing a 'const' qualifier might circumvent the read-only status of an
  object and result in it being modified
* Removing a 'const' qualifier might result in an exception when the object
  is accessed
* Removing a 'volatile' qualifier might result in accesses to the object
  being optimized away
* Removing an _Atomic qualifier might circumvent the lock status of an object
  and potentially result in memory corruption"
[MISRA C:2012 Rule 11.8 with Amendment 4]

volatile int* v1;
const volatile int* v2;
void bar(int*);
int* foo1(_Atomic int* v3) {
    const int* v4 = v1;         // Violation (volatile removed)
    v4 = v2;                    // Violation (volatile removed)
    bar(v3);                    // Violation (_Atomic removed)
    return v2;                  // Violation (const, volatile removed)
}
int* foo2(_Atomic int* v3) {
    const int* v4 = (const int*)v1;   // Violation (volatile removed)
    v4 = (const int*)v2;              // Violation (volatile removed)
    bar((int*)v3);                    // Violation (_Atomic removed)
    return (int*)v2;                  // Violation (const, volatile removed)
