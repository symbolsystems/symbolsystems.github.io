Enumerated types should not be mixed with integer types in generic selections [MISRAC2012-RULE_23_6-b-2]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Because an enumerated type is compatible with its implementation-defined
underlying type, it is not distinguishable from the underlying type by
_Generic (although distinguishing different enumerated types is possible
because this compatibility is not transitive). Attempting to list both would
be a constraint violation. Therefore, using an enumerated type as the
controlling expression to a generic selection that lists the underlying type,
or vice versa, is always a violation." [MISRA C:2012 Amendment 3]

"Each enumerated type shall be compatible with char, a signed integer type,
or an unsigned integer type. The choice of type is implementation-defined,
but shall be capable of representing the values of all the members of the
enumeration." [ISO/IEC 9899:2011]

The rule detects when:
- the controlling expression of a generic selection has an enumerated type
  and a char, a signed integer type or an unsigned integer type is used
  in the association list, or
- the controlling expression of a generic selection has a char, a signed
  integer type or an unsigned integer type and an enumerated type is used
  in the association list

EXAMPLE

<PRE>

enum E {A = 0, B = 1};

#define GENERIC(X) (_Generic ((X) \
 , int: 1                         \
 , default: 2))

void f1(int a)
{
    int i = _Generic ((a), enum E: 1, default: 2);          // Violation
    enum E e;
    i = GENERIC(e);                                         // Violation
}

REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

To fix the code, do not use enumerated types in controlling expressions
and the association lists of generic selections.
