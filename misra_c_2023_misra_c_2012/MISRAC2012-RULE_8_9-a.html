DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Declaring an object at block scope reduces the possibility that the object
might be accessed inadvertently and makes clear the intention that it should
not be accessed elsewhere.
Within a function, whether objects are declared at the outermost or innermost
block is largely a matter of style." [MISRA C:2012 Rule 8.9 with Amendment 4]

This rule detects when a global variable with internal linkage is only used
inside a single function in a translation unit.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule does not apply to const variables of POD-type declared in header
files.
This rule does not detect variables that are not used at all.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule helps you improve code readability and maintainability.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
DRAWBACKS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule might report false positive violations when a const or constexpr
variable is used as a template argument.

template &lt;int C&gt; class AT { };

static constexpr int LOC1 = 10U;  // false positive

void f1()
{
    int x1 = LOC1;
}

void f2()
{
    AT&lt;LOC1&gt; var1;
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

static int max = 10;        // Violation
void foo( ) {
    while(max &gt;= 0) {
        max--;
    }
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

void foo( ) {
    int max = 10;           // OK
    while(max &gt;= 0) {
        max--;
    }
}
