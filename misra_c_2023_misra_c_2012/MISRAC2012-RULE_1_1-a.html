DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"A program shall not exceed the translation limits imposed by the
implementation. The minimum translation limits are specified
by The Standard but an implementation may provide higher limits."
[MISRA C:2012 Rule 1.1]

This rule detects cases where the minimum translation limits specified
by the C90 standard are exceeded:
- 12 pointer, array, and function declarators (in any combinations) modifying
  an arithmetic, a structure, a union, or an incomplete type in a declaration
- 31 parameters in one function definition
- 31 characters in an internal identifier
- 31 characters in an external identifier (the limit specified in the standard
  is 6, but this rule was set to 31 by default)
- 127 identifiers with block scope declared in one block
- 127 enumeration constants in a single enumeration
- 32767 bytes in an object
- 31 arguments in one function call
- 257 case labels for a switch statement (excluding those for any
  nested switch statements)
- 15 nesting levels of compound statements, iteration control structures,
  and selection control structures
- 127 members in a single structure or union
- 15 levels of nested structure or union definitions in a single
  struct-declaration-list
- 511 external identifiers in one translation unit

NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

You can use the Rule Wizard to change the default limits, if necessary.
These limits are defined in the Python method 'defineLimits'.
For example, if you need to increase the limit for the number of characters
in an internal identifier to 127, change the following definition:

  # characters in an internal identifier
  Limit_InternalIdentifierNameLength = 31

 to:
  # characters in an internal identifier
  Limit_InternalIdentifierNameLength = 127

This rule prevents undefined behaviors and improves readability of code.
