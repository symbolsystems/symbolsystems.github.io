DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Information written to log files can be of a sensitive nature and give
valuable guidance to an attacker or expose sensitive user information".
[CWE-532] 

This rule detects when sensitive data is written to log files.
The rule must be parameterized to define sensitive data and specify logging
functions; see PARAMETERS.

<STRONG>
SECURITY RELEVANCE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"While logging all information may be helpful during development stages, it is
important that logging levels be set appropriately before a product ships so 
that sensitive user data and system information are not accidentally exposed 
to potential attackers". [CWE-532]

<STRONG>
PARAMETERS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The 'Secure data processing functions' parameter allows you to specify
functions that can convert sensitive data to safe values.
Fill in the following columns to configure a function.
- 'Enabled' - enables or disables the securing function. If disabled, the rule
    does not consider the data processed by the function to be secure.
- 'Fully qualified type name or namespace (wildcard)' - specifies
    the fully qualified name of the type that declares the function. You can
    use "*" for a function declared in any type.
- 'Function name (wildcard)' - specifies the name of the function.
- '+ definitions in subclasses' - if enabled, the information configured in
    the current row applies to function with the specified name that are
    defined in subclasses of the given class. Note that this applies to both
    instance and non-instance functions.
- 'Returns secured data' - if enabled, the function secures its return value.
- 'Secured parameters' - specifies which function parameters are secured by
    the function. List 1-based indexes of parameters separated by a comma or
    use "*" to specify that all function parameters are secured.
By default, the following function is considered to secure the data it processes:
 - '[Ss]ecure*'

The 'Logging functions' parameter allows you to specify functions that write
information to log files. The rule triggers when sensitive data is passed as
a parameter to one of the listed functions.

Fill in the following columns to configure additional logging functions.
- 'Enabled' - enables or disables the logging function. If disabled, the rule
    does not consider the functions to be a logging function.
- 'Fully qualified type name or namespace (wildcard)' - specifies
    the fully qualified name of the type that declares the function. You can
    use "*" for a function declared in any type.
- 'Function name (wildcard)' - specifies the name of the function.
- "+ definitions in subclasses" - if enabled, the information configured in
    the current row applies to function with the specified name that are
    defined in subclasses of the given class. Note that this applies to both
    instance and non-instance functions.
- 'Logged parameters' - specifies which function parameters should be checked
    for being sensitive. List 1-based indexes of parameters separated by a comma
    or use "*" to specify that all function parameters should be checked.
By default, the rule checks the parameters of the following functions:
- the "*Log*" function of "*[Ll]og*" type
- the "*log*" function of "*[Ll]og*" type
- the "*[Ii]nfo*" function of "*[Ll]og*" type
- the "*[Ww]arn*" function of "*[Ll]og*" type
- the "*[Ee]rror*" function of "*[Ll]og*" type

The 'Sensitive variables' parameter allows you to specify the names of
variables that the rule considers to be sensitive.
Fill in the following columns to configure a sensitive variable:
- 'Enabled' - enables or disables the sensitive variable. If disabled, the rule
    does not consider the variable to be sensitive.
- 'Fully qualified variable name (wildcard)' - specifies the fully qualified
name of the variable. You can use "*" to specify that all variables are
considered to be sensitive.
By default, the following variable names are considered to be sensitive:
- '*[Pp]assword*'
- '*[Pp]asswd*'
 
The 'Sensitive functions' parameter allows you to specify functions the rule
considers to be sensitive.
- 'Enabled' - enables or disables the sensitive function. If disabled, the rule
    does not consider the function to be a sensitive function.
- 'Fully qualified type name or namespace (wildcard)' - specifies the fully qualified name
    of the type that declares the function. You can use "*" for a function
    declared in any type.
- 'Function name (wildcard)' - specifies the name of the function.
- '+ definitions in subclasses' - if enabled, the information configured in
    the current row applies to functions with the specified name that are
    defined in subclasses of the given class. Note that this applies to both
    instance and non-instance functions.
- ''this' object is sensitive' - if enabled, the function makes the object it is
    called on sensitive.
- 'Returns sensitive data' - if enabled, the function makes its return value
    sensitive.
- 'Sensitive parameters' - specifies which function parameters are made
    sensitive by the function. List 1-based indexes of parameters separated by
    a comma or use "*" to specify that all function parameters are affected.
By default, the following function is considered to be sensitive:
- '*[Pp]assword*'

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

This rule helps you prevent the exposure of sensitive data to potential
attackers.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

In the following example, sensitive data is passed to the 'error' function,
which writes data to a file.

class Logger {
public:
    void error(const char * msg) {}
};

const char* getPassword();

void test01(Logger log){
    const char* password = getPassword();
    log.error(password);            // VIOLATION
}



</PRE>
<STRONG>
REPAIR
</STRONG>
<PRE>

You can fix the code by securing the password with the secure data processing
function 'secure' before writing the data to a file.

class Logger {
public:
    void error(const char * msg) {}
};

const char* getPassword();
const char* secure(const char*);

void test01(Logger log){
    const char* password = getPassword();
    log.error(secure(password));    // NO VIOLATION
}
