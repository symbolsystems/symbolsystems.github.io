DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"The operands of logical operators (&amp;&amp;, ||, !) should be 'effectively Boolean'.
An 'effectively Boolean' expression which is either 'Boolean-by-construct'
or 'Boolean-by-enforcement' as defined below.
Boolean-by-construct values are produced by the following operators:
- equality operators (== and !=)
- logical operators (!, &amp;&amp; and ||)
- relational operators (&lt;, &gt;, &lt;= and &gt;=)
Boolean-by-enforcement values can be introduced by implementing a specific type
enforcement mechanism using a tool. A Boolean type could be associated with
a specific typedef, and would then be used for any objects that are Boolean."

Rule does not report violation if as an operand of logical operator is used:
- Boolean-by-construct values
- boolean constant
- integer or enum constant defined as '0' or '1' 
- variable, parameter or expression of type:
  - bool,
  - typedef to bool,
  - enum that name begins with 'bool' (ignoring case)
    and that contains exactly 2 enum constant in body
  - typedef to char/short/int/enum which name begins with 'bool' (ignoring case) 
  - reference to above types

<PRE>

Rule improves readability and maintainability.
Rule prevents confusion between logical and bitwise operators.

int goo();

    int x, y, z;

    z = (x &gt; y) &amp;&amp; goo();         // Violation
    z = (x &gt; y) || goo();         // Violation
    z = !(x = y);                 // Violation
