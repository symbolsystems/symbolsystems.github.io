DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"ISO C defines a number of different name spaces. It is technically
possible to use the same name in separate name spaces to represent
completely different items. However this practice is deprecated because
of the confusion it can cause, and so names should not be reused, even
in separate name spaces."
There are four namespaces in the C Language
1. Label names
2. Tags of structure, unions and enumerations
3. Members of structs and unions; each struct/union as a separate namespace
4. All other identifiers; e.g. enum constants, variables, functions, typedefs

<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The output message shows only the first place (line) where the same
name is used in the other name space.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
EXCEPTIONS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"An exception to this rule is the naming of members of structures, 
where members names may be reused within separate structures."



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Rule improves readability and maintainability of code.

EXAMPLE

typedef struct MyStruct  // tags name space
{
  int Member;            // members name space
} MyStruct;              // Violation - identifiers name space

<PRE>

typedef struct MyStruct  // tags name space
{
  int Member;             // members name space
} MyStructObj;            // OK - identifiers name space
