Implicit conversions from wider to narrower integral type which may result in a loss of information shall not be used [CERT_C-INT02-a-2]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"C and C++ perform many type conversions implicitly and silently,
so as to harmonize types within an expression before evaluating it.
Some of these conversions can result in loss of information. 
Such implicit conversions shall not be used, but explicit casts
should be used instead."

The rule reports a violation if an expression of integral type
is implicitly converted to a narrower integral type.

See also: MISRA2004-10_1_b, MISRA2004-10_1_d, MISRA2004-10_2_a,
MISRA2004-10_2_b, PORT-27, PORT-28, PB-56

<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule assumes the following order of sizes:
char &lt; short &lt; int &lt; long &lt; long long
signed 'type' &lt; unsigned 'type'  e.g. signed int &lt; unsigned int

The rule assumes that the size of an enumeration type in the same
as the size of signed int type.

The integral type of expression is detected as the type
that would be obtained from evaluating an expression
if it were not for the effects of integral promotion.

<STRONG>
EXCEPTIONS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule does not report violation if a conversion is used:
- on a constant expression
- on a bit field

BENEFITS

<PRE>

"Explicit casts should normally only be used in the case where a conversion 
which could result in a loss of information is specifically required by the 
programmer. If the static checking of implicit conversions is overridden by
the use of explicit casts in this way, then the programmer should be aware
of the issues of truncation and lost of precision associated with the operation,
and should provide appropriate checking of values in the code"

    si = ui;                /* Violation: unsigned int assigned to signed int */
