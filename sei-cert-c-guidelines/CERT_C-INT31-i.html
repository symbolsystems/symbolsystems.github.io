DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"The C language allows the programmer considerable freedom and will permit 
assignments between different arithmetic types to be performed automatically.
However, the use of these implicit conversions can lead to unintended results,
with the potential for loss of value, sign or precision. The use of stronger
typing, as enforced by the MISRA essential type model, reduces the likelihood
of these problems occurring." [MISRA C:2012 Rule 10.3]

This rule detects cases when the value of an expression is assigned to an
object with a different essential type category or if the constant expression
in a switch statement's case label is converted to a different essential type
category.

The term "essential type" is defined by the MISRA C:2012 standard, 
but tools may also provide additional ways of identifying "essentially 
Boolean" types.

NOTES

"The following operations are covered by this rule:
- Assignment by means of one of the assignment operators;
- Passing an argument to a function, in which case the argument is copied as 
  if by assignment to the corresponding parameter;
- Returning an expression from a function, in which case the result is copied
  as if by assignment to an object with the function's return type;
- Using an expression to initialize all or part of an object, including a 
  compound literal in C99, in which case the expression is copied as if by 
  assignment to the destination;
- The conversion of the constant expression in a switch statementâ€™s case label
  to the promoted type of the controlling expression."
[MISRA C:2012 Rule 10.3, Appendix J]

The rule assumes that "essentially Boolean" type is defined as one of
the following:
  - _Bool type defined in the C99 standard library 'stdbool'
  - the result of a relational, equality and logical operator
  - an enumeration type whose name begins with 'bool' (case insensitive)
    or contains 'boolean' (case insensitive) and contains exactly 2 enumeration
    constants
  - typedef whose name begins with 'bool' (case insensitive)
    or contains 'boolean' (case insensitive) to:
    -- a char type defined explicitly as signed or unsigned
    -- a short or int type
    -- an enumeration type which contains exactly 2 enumeration constants

Enumeration constants have "essentially Boolean" type if they are defined
inside "essentially Boolean" types.

Integer constants with values '0' and '1' are considered to be constants of
"essentially Boolean" type.

This rule does not check compound assignment operators. Such operators
are checked by the CODSTA-164_a rule. The only exceptions are:

- the compound additive operator when the first operand has the essentially
  signed or essentially unsigned type and the second operand has essentially
  character type

void foo(void) {
    signed int si;
    unsigned int ui;
    char c;
    si += c;    /* Violation - correct for rule CODSTA-164_a */
    ui += c;    /* Violation - correct for rule CODSTA-164_a */
    si += ui;   /* OK - incorrect for rule CODSTA-164_a */
}

- the compound binary operator when the first operand has the essentially
  real floating type and the second operand has essentially complex floating
  type

void foo(void) {
    float f;
    double d;
    _Complex float cf;
    f += cf;           /* Violation - correct for rule CODSTA-164_a */
    d *= cf;           /* Violation - correct for rule CODSTA-164_a */
}

EXCEPTIONS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"A non-negative integer constant expression of essentially signed type may be
assigned to an object of essentially unsigned type if its value can be 
represented in that type." [MISRA C:2012 Rule 10.3]

This exception refers only to simple integer constants. If a complex constant
expression is used in an assignment, a violation will still be reported.

void foo(void) {
    unsigned int ui;
    ui = 10;          /* OK */
    ui = 5 + 5;       /* reported Violation */
}
 
"The initializer { 0 } may be used to initialize an aggregate or union type."
[MISRA C:2012 Rule 10.3]

"An essentially real floating expression may be assigned to an object
of essentially complex floating type provided that its corresponding
real type is not narrower than the type of the expression."
[MISRA C:2012 Amendment 3]
