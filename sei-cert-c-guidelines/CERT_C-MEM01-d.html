Always assign a new value to parameter or local variable that points to deallocated memory [CERT_C-MEM01-d-2]

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

All pointers should be set to either 0 or to a valid address immediately
after delete statement.
The rule reports a violation if directly after delete used on 
local variable there is no assignment to this variable.
See also: MRM-09, MRM-10, MRM-31



</PRE>
<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Violation is not reported if delete is a last statement in function
(ignoring other delete and return statements).
Some violations can be not reported on MSVC compiler
if an assignment is used before delete statement inside macro.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Rule prevents accessing a pointer or a reference to a deleted object.

EXAMPLE

<PRE>

void foo(int* p){
    p = new int;
    int* q = new int(5);
    //....
    delete p;	// Violation - set deleted pointer in next expression
    delete q;	// Violation - set deleted pointer in next expression
    p = 0;
    q = new int(10);
    //...
    return;
}

REPAIR

<PRE>

void foo(int* p){
    p = new int;
    int* q = new int(5);
    //....
    delete p;	// OK
    p = 0;
    delete q;	// OK
    q = new int(10);
    //...
    delete q;	// OK
