DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"Bit fields shall only be defined to be of type unsigned int or signed int.
Using int is implementation-defined because bit fields of type int can be 
either signed or unsigned. The use of enum, short or char types for bit fields 
is not allowed because the behaviour is undefined." [MISRA C:2004]



</PRE>
<STRONG>
NOTES
</STRONG>
<PRE>

In C99, the implementation may define other integer types that are permitted
in bit-field declarations. This rule is compliant with c90, so violations are
reported only if a bit-field type is different than signed int or unsigned int.



</PRE>
<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Prevents implementation-defined behaviour.

EXAMPLE

enum Enum { E1, E2};
struct Struct 
{
    unsigned char  f1:2;  /* Violation */
    unsigned short f2:2;  /* Violation */
    unsigned long  f3:2;  /* Violation */
    enum Enum      f4:2;  /* Violation */
    int            f5:2;  /* Violation */
};
