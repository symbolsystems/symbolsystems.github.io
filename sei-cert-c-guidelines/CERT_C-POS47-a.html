DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The pthread_setcanceltype() sets the cancelability type of the calling
thread to the value given in the first argument. The new cancellation type
can be set to one of the following:
PTHREAD_CANCEL_ASYNCHRONOUS - The thread can be canceled at any time
PTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERRED - A cancellation request is deferred until the thread
                          calls a function that is a cancellation point

This rule detects when the pthread_setcanceltype() function is called
with the PTHREAD_CANCEL_ASYNCHRONOUS value.

BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

Helps you avoid canceling threads asynchronously (immediately), which may be
dangerous. Most threads are not safe to cancel immediately. If a thread can
be canceled at any time, it cannot safely reserve resources. As a result,
the application has no way of knowing what the state of these resources is when
the thread is canceled.

EXAMPLE
</STRONG>
<PRE>

#include &lt;pthread.h&gt;

volatile int a = 5;
volatile int b = 10;

pthread_mutex_t global_lock = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;

void* worker_thread(void* dummy) {
    int i;
    int c;

    pthread_setcanceltype(PTHREAD_CANCEL_ASYNCHRONOUS, &amp;i);    // Violation
    while (1) {
        pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;global_lock);
        c = b;
        b = a;
        a = c;
        pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;global_lock);
    }
    return NULL;
}

REPAIR

<PRE>

The function 'pthread_setcanceltype()' should not be called
with the 'PTHREAD_CANCEL_ASYNCHRONOUS' argument
