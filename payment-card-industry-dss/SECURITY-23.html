DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>
<PRE>

The rule reports a violation if in code is used the function GetTempPath().
"GetTempPath() returns the file path to the temporary directory.
GetTempPath() raises two concerns. First, a buffer overflow condition could
exist if the path to the temporary directory is longer than the buffer
allocated to store this information. Second, a path to an insecure directory
could be returned. Also, Windows does not guarantee that the returned paths
are valid or useable (e.g. writable) for temporary files."

<STRONG>
BENEFITS
</STRONG>
<PRE>

"An attacker could take advantage of either weakness in the functionality
of GetTempPath(). First, if Windows returns a path to which the attacker
can read or write (e.g. c:\temp), he or she will be able to read or alter
any data in the temporary files. This would result in a breach
of confidentiality and integrity, respectively.
The second attack vector is to implement a buffer overflow attack.
There is no indication that the value in any of the environment
variables (TMP, TEMP) is truncated to MAX_PATH. Therefore, an attacker
could specify an environment variable whose length is longer than that
of the path buffer if the buffer's length is not set properly. When the
program was run in this environment, the path buffer would be overflowed."
The rule prevents such attacks.

EXAMPLE

<PRE>

#include &lt;afx.h&gt;

const char * virus_temp_sig = "XXX";

char * get_temp_file()

{
    char wintemp_path[1024];
    char *temp_path=new char[1024];

    GetTempPath(1024,wintemp_path);                              // Violation
    GetTempFileName(wintemp_path,virus_temp_sig,1234,temp_path);
    return temp_path;
}

<PRE>

Do not use the GetTempPath() functions or at least be careful what you place
in locations returned by them.
